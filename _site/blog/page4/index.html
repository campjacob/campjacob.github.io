<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2014/3/bitten-years-ago-ive-got-the-bug">Thursday March 27, 2014</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/adobe-illistrator-travel-bug-header.jpg" alt="Travel Bug" /> Yes, I have the Travel Bug. A graphic I quickly put together in Adobe Illustrator depicting the words “Travel Bug” and some other graphics taken from <a href="http://all-free-download.com/free-vector/vector-misc/the_bee_145061.html">All Free Downloads The Bee</a></p>

<p>I’m getting more and more excite for my Trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a> for <a href="/http://www.macworldiworld.com">Macworld / iWorld</a> – See my post <a href="/blog/2014/3/its-final-plan-tickets-bought">It’s Final, Tickets Bought</a>. I’m currently sitting in the <a href="http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Pages/default.aspx">SeaTac Airport</a>, waiting for my flight to leave in about an hour. I’m sure I will have more to share in the next couple of days (so expect to see some for frequent posts from me this week if I can get around to it.).</p>

<p>Last night I got to visit my aunt and cousin. It is so good to be able to get to spend time with family. In doing calculations, it seemed as if it wouldn’t be much more expensive to stay somewhere and do the sleep and fly thing and not have to pay for parking. I had previously called <a href="http://www.knightsinn.com/hotels/washington/tukwila/knights-inn-sea-tac-airport/hotel-overview">Knights Inn Sea Tac Airport</a> and was told the price would be around $58. I calculated the cost for parking, it looked like it would be around $40, so the sleep, fly, park option seemed a great deal. It ended up costing closer to $88. I really dislike when things are somewhat deceptive.</p>

<p>Anyways, it all works out. While you wait for more posts, you can read <a href="/blog?category=Travel%20Blog">all of my former travel journals</a>, or my <a href="/blog?tag=Jaunt%20Down%20South%202010">Jaunt Down South 2010</a>, or <a href="/blog?tag=European%20Excursion%202008">European Excursion 2008</a>.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2014/3/word-salad-and-technical-jargon">Sunday March 23, 2014</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/word-saldad-bowl-illustrator-graphic.png" alt=" A graphic I created in  Adobe Illustrator  depicting a vegetables, a salad bowl, and the text " /> A graphic I created in Adobe Illustrator depicting a vegetables, a salad bowl, and the text “word salad.” The veggies used are from <a href="http://all-free-download.com/free-vector/vector-misc/salad_311031.html">All Free Download’s Salad</a> the and I got some inspiration from the <a href="http://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photo-bowl-vegetables-images-mushrooms-style-retro-image34526470">Dreamtimes stock photo: Bowl with Vegetables</a>.

<p>Working in the mental health field when I am working with my clients, I attempt to steer clear of technical jargon. There are times and places that I do use more psychobabble, but if I do use it in session it’s coupled with a description in plain English. This is especially relevant for the clientele that we serve at my agency, which is predominately Medicaid clients. Being a community mental health center, a large percentage of my patients tend to be chronically mentally ill, impoverished, and undereducated. It is always important to make sure that what I am teaching, working on / through is understandable.  While, in my conversations, I attempt to include the smallest amount of specialized terminology as possible, in my documentation I strive to be as technically accurate as possible. This means that prefer to name things using the most appropriate and specific verbiage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Word Salad: Noun<br />
A confused or unintelligible mixture of seemingly random words and phrases, specifically (in psychiatry) as a form of speech indicative of advanced schizophrenia.</p>

  <p>– Oxford University Press</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I do not profess to be experiencing anything remotely close to word salad or more clinically defined as schizophasia. Realistically, its not even in the same class of thought disorders. The last couple of weeks, I’ve been noticing that at home I find myself using an excess of opaque non-technological expressions. Very often for me, this means referring to everything as “the thing.” For example, I’ll ask Minnie “can you hand me the thing,” to which she replies “what thing?” and I realize she has not idea what I’m talking about and say “you know, my water bottle.”</p>

<p>For all of us, this is a normal part of speech, and not abnormal one bit. It’s very common for all of us to have a word not come instantly to mind, and so we use some sort of filler word. I almost wish that the stock word I absentmindedly choose was something with more novelty like <em>doohickey, thingy-a-bob, dongle, whatchamacallit, widget.. etc</em>, mine is pretty <strong>Plain Jane</strong>. We all use different placeholder terms. You should read the the list on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name">Wikipedia article for placeholder names</a> which has some really interesting ones that I’m trying to figure out how to incorporate into my everyday speech.</p>

<p>The same way, if you are doing public speaking and are attempting to stop saying “Umm” (or more frequently “like” for me personally), that I see myself calling any object a thing. It might be, that I’ve been thinking about my over use of “thing,” but it made me wonder if some of it could be because of my days being spent attempting to be clear, concise, and as accurate as possible. Just maybe, it’s as if I save up all my casual phrases and use an abundance whenever I’m away from work.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/Macworld-iWorld-2014-banner-square.jpg" alt=" I'm GOING! " class="align-left" /> I’m GOING!</p>

<p>I’ve been itching to travel again, as it’s been a really long time since I’ve gone any considerable distances (since I came back from my <a href="/blog?tag=Jaunt%20Down%20South%202010">J</a><a href="/blog?tag=Jaunt%20Down%20South%202010">aunt Down to South America</a>). In two weeks, I’ll be heading down to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a> for the <a href="http://www.macworldiworld.com">Macworld / iWorld event</a>. It’s a trade show and conference. This year, I can only really afford to do the expo hall, but hopefully in future years I might be able to attend the actual conference portion. Minnie has been calling it my nerd conference. I guess I have a lot more nerdery that I partake in, then I share here. Minnie’s always reminding me about it. When I’m driving, and want to listen to <a href="/blog?tag=Podcasts">my podcasts</a>, she calls them my  nerd casts. She makes fun of me because after she goes to bed, I’ve been watching my nerd show. Netflix is amazing. I’ve never watched <a href="http://www.startrek.com/page/star-trek-the-next-generation">Star Trek Next Generation</a>, and I’ve always been much more of the original <a href="http://starwars.com">Star Wars</a> Fan. I’m enjoying it.</p>

<p>With all of those great nerd activities, it makes sense for me to be going to a nerd conference. I’m sure that I will be posting more as I go along.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2014/3/review-of-david-sparkss-markdown-book-an-investigation-to-formatting-documents">Sunday March 2, 2014</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>With the <a href="/blog/2014/2/adventures-unexpected-going-ipad-only">hard drive on my MacBook Pro out of commission</a>, and that over the last year I’ve completely changed how I manage data storage, I figured it was time to write a review of <a href="http://macsparky.com">David Sparks </a>’s <a href="http://macsparky.com/fieldguides/">Field Guide</a> <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">Markdown</a> (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/markdown/id622433972?mt=11">buy it iTunes</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/book-cover-markdown-field-guide.jpg" alt="  Book Cover for David Sparks's Field Guide: Markdown.  " /> Book Cover for David Sparks’s Field Guide: Markdown.</p>

<p>I wrote really briefly about Markdown in my post, <a href="/blog/2013/6/been-so-long">Been So Long</a>. I’ve been transitioning most all of my documents into plain text files. For the non plain text nerds out there, this might sound a little strange. In my viewpoint, there is a real case to be made for plain text files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Space</strong>: Plain text files take up almost no space on your hard drive, can be stored easily and quickly in the cloud.</li>
  <li><strong>Size</strong>: Even on my MacBook Pro, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/">Microsoft Word</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/pages/">Apple Pages</a> (although Pages seems to load significantly faster and I really prefer it), documents take time to load. Text files are so small and simple, it loads almost instantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Search-ability</strong>: With programs like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a>, I can easily find and edit all of my text files, even if they are just small little snippets of information, I can find it quickly and easily.</li>
  <li><strong>Survivability</strong>: File formats change. There are a number of word processing files types that I wouldn’t have any way of ever opening anymore. Storing files in a plan text file isn’t ever going to go away. It’s kind of like the very base structure that you can have, so it is easily importable, and exportable and will always be able to be opened.</li>
</ul>

<p>Markdown is almost like a very simple (super simple, really you probably already do it) way of writing that that can be written in plain text and exported into a rich text format. For example if you’ve ever written an “*” or a “-“ to make a bulleted list, then that is markdown. It gives you some of the basic features that you might want to use in your writing to help with the formating, but nothing nearly as complex as you can do either in HTML or in a word processing docuement. Many programs can take your plain text file, and export it into a rich text format so that it looks pretty as if you did in a word processer.</p>

<p>John Grubber at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Daring Fireball: Markdown Overview</a>, was the one who first created Markdown. There are other syntaxes that are similar in nature for plain text to that of Markdown that have expanded purposes, features, and uses. There is even a syntax called <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain for writing scripts in</a>.</p>

<p>David and Eddie’s book was written in <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author</a>, and is created and especially for iBooks. That means it has features not normally available to other e-books. Along with the great descriptions, design astetics, it also has hours of audio and video embedded in the e-book. You can also purchase the PDF version and have access to the additional features through David’s website. If I’ve peaked your curiosity, I’d highly recommend downloading the book on your iPad! You should also check out my favorite podcast, <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>, in which David is a co-host. I’ve written about <a href="/?tag=Mac+Power+Users">their show</a> frequently over the several months.</p>

<p>My life always seems to be full of adventures, or maybe like so many other things, it’s only a matter of perspective. Especially when I’ve been <a href="/blog/?category=Travel+Blog">traveling</a> in the past, I’ve found my self with <a href="/blog/?tag=Travel+Troubles">all kinds of difficulties</a> and random adventures.</p>

<p>I’ve been using my MacBook Pro very heavily over the past year and a couple of months since purchased it. I take it with me to work, and use it there. I use it for creating <a href="/blog/?tag=Design">graphics and other design projects</a>. It seems like I’m almost always on it. On Friday, I got home and I was going to keep working on the Keynote presentation I’m making for work regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> and Mental Health on Wednesday. I had used it prior in the day, and there seemed to be no problems.</p>

<p>When I clicked the on button, there was the happy chime saying that it was starting, but it just never actually started. After about a half a minute I was accosted by the white screen of death (similar to the blue screen of death on a windows machine I’d imagine). There in front of me was bright white screen with a blinking folder with a question mark on it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/white-screen-of-death.jpg" alt="A graphic I found with the white screen of death." class="align-left" /> A graphic I found with the white screen of death.</p>

<p>I purchased my computer at Best Buy and with any large purchase like this, I get a couple of years of Geek Squad protection. It means even if I throw my laptop a cross the room, I can get it replaced for free.  It great, that even though my Mac is out of warranty and my hard drive failed, I’m going to get it fixed for free. It will just take a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>My plan is to go iPad only.  I’m actually pretty sure I will be able to get by pretty well.  It should be an interesting experiment.</p>

<p>A photo I took when I was living in <a href="/blog?tag=Cusco%20Peru">Cusco Peru</a>, asking “how’s your facial symmetry?”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/mateo-campbell-facial-symmetry.png" alt="I used a photo of from  Mateo's baby dedication  to complete a  Ana Faces Facial Beauty Analysis .  He got a 7.37 although I think he's much cuter than that." /></p>

<p>I used a photo of from <a href="/events/2013/12/mateos-baby-dedication-at-a-very-merry-eastlake-christmas-party">Mateo’s baby dedication</a> to complete a <a href="http://www.anaface.com">Ana Faces Facial Beauty Analysis</a>.  He got a 7.37 although I think he’s much cuter than that.</p>

<p><a href="http://freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a> recently had an episode of their podcast, <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2014/01/30/reasons-to-not-be-ugly-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">Reasons to Not Be Ugly</a>. The episode looks at beauty, and how it effects peoples lives from being a cute baby to working and marriage relationships in adulthood. It was pretty interesting.</p>

<p>It made me think about how fussy people are for Mateo. When I take him to the store and other public locations, people are always fussing over him and saying how cute he is. This helps me to justify my feelings and bias that Mateo is by far one of the cutest babies out there.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/jacob-campbell-facial-symmetry-score.png" alt="A photo I took when I was living in  Cusco Peru , It's probably not the best photo I could choose to check my facial symmetry, but it made me laugh.  My score from  Ana Faces Facial Beauty Analysis  was a 3.13." /></p>

<p>A photo I took when I was living in <a href="/blog?tag=Cusco%20Peru">Cusco Peru</a>, It’s probably not the best photo I could choose to check my facial symmetry, but it made me laugh.  My score from <a href="http://www.anaface.com">Ana Faces Facial Beauty Analysis</a> was a 3.13.</p>

<p>If you had previously asked me how to tell the attractiveness of an individual, I would not have guessed that facial symmetry would be a good way to identify attractiveness. I decided that I needed to have a more objective way of measuring both my and Mateo’s attractiveness. For Mateo, he scored a 7.37 (although I would say he should be higher and I just didn’t put the points accurately). It is still a good score, especially for somebody who still has a lot of growth to happen. I used, <a href="http://www.anaface.com">Ana face</a>’s Facial Beauty Analysis. I ended up uploading one of my pictures, but it did not turn out that I was nearly as cute as Mateo. I will say, that the photo I uploaded was a bit more joking and probably one that doesn’t quite do me justice. I’m ok with my score of 3.13. I can rest assured that at least Mateo will not be discriminated against based on his looks.</p>

<p>One of my favorite podcasts to listen to every week is the <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>. I can give credit to their show for the majority of the productivity and ability to best make use of my mac from their show. If you’re a apple products user, I’d highly recommend their show, it’s pretty amazing. I’ve sent a couple of emails to the hosts over and have listened to so many of their episodes, I feel like I almost know them.  A couple of weeks ago, I responded to a call to talk about how users use <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>.  I have been heavily using TextExpander both at home and at work.  Looking at my statistics this morning, over the last couple of months, I’ve saved almost 17 hours of typing time.  When I was listening to their show on Monday, riding my bike home, I was surprised and excited to hear them share from my email on the program.  I am very sure it was about me, but they said the listener’s name was Jared, not Jacob.  It’s OK, it still made me feel super famous!</p>

<p>The episode is about <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/">GarageBand</a>.  It is a pretty cool product.  I’ve played around with it some, but I’m hoping to dive a little more into it after listening to <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2014/01/26/mac-power-users-174-garageband-for-everyone-and-macworld-2014/">the episode</a>. They also talked about Macworld iWorld 2014.  I’m actually hoping to be able to go.  You should listen to the episode, it was really great.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2014/1/atomic-throw-down-poster-designs">Sunday January 19, 2014</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>A while ago, I was doing quite a few poster designs for <a href="http://www.nscrossfit.com">Natural Selection CrossFit</a> (<a href="http://fb.com/nsxfit">Facebook</a>). I do really doing graphic design projects, although lately I feel I have been too busy to do much of it. This project took almost 20 hours to put together, and went through a number of iterations. When I was first talking to the client, they described wanting something <strong>Superbowlish</strong> because the event will be taking place on Superbowl Sunday, (you can <a href="http://fb.com/events/651206994943583/">sign up to participate</a>). The following are the first three design concepts I had. I wasn’t really too happy with any of them, and these are just quick mock ups and not final versions.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/crossfit-poster-design-boxing-rink-concept.jpg" alt=" When I was originally asked to come up with a poster design, this is what I had in my head.  I'm assuming a part of it is because I'm really not much of a football fan. " /> When I was originally asked to come up with a poster design, this is what I had in my head.

<p>After going through putting these concept together, they had come up with a different design concept, one which I really liked and think turned out pretty awesome. Retro looking posters are pretty cool, and they talked about wanting to have a design like the old school Pee Chee’s. You can see the 11x16 and the 8.5x11 versions of the posters. I even made a cover image to go along with their Facebook page.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/Atomic-Throwdown-11x16-Large-Poster.jpg" alt=" This is the 11x16 Poster version.  You can check out a  PDF version  or the  Adobe Illustrator File  if you are interested.

<p>All in all it was a fun project.  I’d love to know what you guy’s think about the designs.  I’m pretty satisfied with the final version.</p>
