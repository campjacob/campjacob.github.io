<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2008/11/stupid-flash-debugging">Sunday November 16, 2008</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>I taught myself xHTML, CSS several years ago. Since then I have learned some PHP and JavaScript, VisualBasic, and C++. The newest thing that I have been working on is Fash. It’s been really interesting, but I don’t think I have a great grasp on action script and I can even fail at following a <a href="/assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-try.swf">Tutorial</a> on creating a gallery. I like to work though some things like this to take breaks from studying and other projects that I am working on. The final product was supposed to look like this <a href="/assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-example.swf">tutorial gallery</a>:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;iframe src="/assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-example.swf"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>Code no longer works for embed</li>
</ul>

<p>But mine (remember that some of it was quickly done… so isn’t as pretty) <a href="/assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-try.swf">Flash Gallery Tutorial</a> did not work:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;iframe src="/assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-try.swf"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>Code no longer works for embed</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways, I guess enough playing around with it today. I’ll have to go back though and see where I messed up later, I need to work on my literature review for my research project.</p>

<p>My church, <a href="http://www.victoryfaith.org/ (Victory Faith Fellowship)">Victory Faith Fellowship</a>, has been undergoing a lot of changes lately.</p>

<p>One huge leap of faith that we have made is in purchasing a new building. It has really been an amazing story of our church following after Gods dreams, which are bigger than anything that we could do ourself. It has really been a great ride so far. This Sunday, we will have our first meeting at <a href="http://g.co/maps/e85h2 (Google Maps of 2024 N Argonne Rd)">2024 N Argonne Rd</a>.</p>

<p>Checking out my Google Analytics this morning, I realized that my website has been visited by people in every state this previous month. It’s like I can travel around the country (really the world for that matter) every month. <a href="/assets/media/google-analytics_report-map.pdf">My Analytics US Map Overlay</a> tells me that I’ve had visitors from 52 states. One of the extra is unspecified and the other is Washington DC. I thought thought that it was a pretty cool thought. Also, it’s pretty cool that I got 1,412 visits this month. That number is pretty constant too. Someday I will probably upload monthly reports so other people can follow my traffic.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2008/11/fervent-retreat">Monday November 3, 2008</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/media/photo-fervant-fall-retreat-crowd-friends.jpg" alt="  Fervent  Fall Retreat at  Camp Tshimakain, Ford WA  " class="align-center" /> Fervent  Fall Retreat at Camp Tshimakain, Ford WA</p>

<p>This weekend was the Fervent <a href="http://www.victoryfaith.org/">Victory Faith</a>’s <a href="http://www.victoryfaith.org/fervent/">college age group called Fervent</a> retreat. It was awesome. Unfortunately I did not get to go up for the entire event. I worked on Friday until about 1am. I got up there Saturday and it was pretty awesome. As Joe would say “I got saved.”</p>

<p>It has been a long time since I’ve really felt connected with church or even some sort of community. The last couple of years, I’ve had a number of groups that I got to build relationship with, but this year it’s been pretty dry. I have some friends that I hang out with at Eastern, but not nearly as much as when I lived on campus, or even last year when I hung out in Cheney quite a bit. I also haven’t really been to the Spokane Dance Company since I stopped doing the instructor training program. I just really haven’t hung out with people all that much the last couple of months. When I was in Europe, I met tons of people… but friends you make while traveling are way different then people you know more in-depth.</p>

<p>Needless to say, getting to hang out with a bunch of people at <a href="http://www.tcreek.org/">Camp Tshimakain</a> was a very good thing. Joe’s word regarding community (and building relationship last Fervent meeting for that matter) was powerful to me and what I needed to hear. God is so good that way, he always meets us right where we are.</p>

<p>Thank you for everybody I got to hang out with at the retreat, it was the first time I’ve really felt connected in quite a while. It’s been really dry and you are all an encouragement to me. I appreciate all of you so much.</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.510782121816.2028508.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=b998a2f5c8">Fervent Retreat Album</a> from the retreat.

<p><img src="/assets/media/blog-spokane-dominos-pizza-tracker.png" alt=" The pizza tracking page on Domino's " /> The pizza tracking page on Domino’s</p>

<p>I got off work tonight, and was hungry. I don’t have any food in my house, and am in desperate need of going grocery shopping. For some reason, this didn’t sound like a good idea at almost midnight when I got home. I decided to order pizza. Looking up <a href="http://www.dominos.com/ (Domino's)">dominoes</a> online, I found their order process super easy and kind of cool. I just had to enter information, and it placed my order. The confirmation page (see below) told me who began baking my pizza and when, and the same for putting it in the oven, boxing it up, and leaving for delivery. That’s pretty sweet. Probably more information than I need to know, but still very cool to know.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of working in the afternoon is that I have time to take my mornings slowly. I tend to sit outside and and drink a cup of coffee and read the news most mornings now. I read my news from <a href="http://news.google.com/ (Google News)">Google News</a>. I have made <a href="http://news.google.com/news?ned=%3AePkh8BM9E2IRYipIFZLnEgguyM9OzEvVUQh31FEIDXY0YHFitbQ0MjD12DxXQ4gV6BQDFpDq1By4a1JBwiVAYZhTioWOMXJxB-cnZybmKITnF2VrbWFUQuYqKfgHKSh5lOYm5ikEpxaVZSanQsX8HIPDoazEksz8PKAOx-JikFYQTyE_TQHTnODkjPz8HCQ5qLgn3CznxOJUZB1gvm9iXmI6zF6YToWg1OLUxKLkDC2gKQZsQvJassWZJalW5eXleqmJxSWpRXmpRfl5OZl5qXrJ-bn6QmpaKmAFGSUlBVb6-iB1xcAgTC0G-q0otSwztRysDhY5RgIhcvcuxnCIlhxMeM9Qt_Oe8y82YFj-YmPNyU9OBNLMRanJAI5jdf4 (Personalized Google News)">several personalization</a> to the news that I read, and thought you might be interested in checking them out. You’ll see that in the recommended for me section there is a lot of information regarding technology and the election. I tend to read these a lot. I also have a section that searches the news for all the stories that are connected to social work and related material. I also have Googles local news for my area code and an addition of local news that isn’t included in their searching (the Spokesman Review, and the Easterner my schools newspaper). I hope this is interesting for you.</p>

<p>I must say that I am slightly biased as to which online products I like for various activities. I recently came across <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/2008election/">Google 2008 U.S. Elections</a>. This has many different Google products that bring up various election features. One of these that I think is very cool is the Google Maps Elections ‘08 Map Gallery. One example of the maps that are available is Candidate Queries Map from Google, but their is a host of other ones listed in the gallery.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/cartoon-lost-found-funny-stock.jpg" alt="Good Deed A Day - It features a Lost and Found Booth with boxes of various human feelings." class="align-left" /> This Cartoon was taken from the blog Good Deed A Day . It features a Lost and Found Booth with boxes of various human feelings. While on my trip I didn’t loose my feelings, I felt it was a good picture to use.</p>

<p>During my trip I lost, broke, or other crazy events happened. The following is a list of all the things big and small.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I didn’t get stickers for my water bottle (the one souvenir that i got from every where I went) in <a href="/locations/copenhagen-denmark">Denmark</a> and the <a href="/locations/prague-czech-republic">Czech Republic</a>.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/berin-germany">Berlin</a>, before we even left for our second city… I forgot my favorite hoodie at the bus station. I must say that while in the US I’ve had people offer to buy this hoodie off of me while at coffee shops… maybe I should have taken them up on the offer.</li>
  <li>I lost my time. I bought post cards to sent to friends and family in <a href="/locations/prague-czech-republic">Prague</a>… but never sent them off. I actually thew them away when I got to the US, even though I filled them out.</li>
  <li>In preparation of flying, I sold my tent for €10.00 (about $13.48800)… probably worth at least $100.</li>
  <li><a href="/locations/vienna-austria">Vienna</a> was the first country that we decided to fly from… well actually <a href="/locations/bratislava-slovakia">Bratislava</a>. I threw away a number of other camping gear, rain gear, and several sets of cloths (leaving me with 2 shorts, 1 pants and a bunch of shirts and other stuff) at the airport.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/barcelona-spain">Barcelona</a>, we lost an airplane ticket… we though we were staying an extra day.</li>
  <li>I also tore one of my shorts, leaving me with 1 pair of shorts and 1 pair of pants.</li>
  <li>Due to my computer breaking (see later item in list) I lost many of my pictures of <a href="/locations/rome-italy">Rome</a> and <a href="/locations/bergemo-italy">Bergemo</a>.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/riga-latvia">Lativa</a>, I broke my computer (or maybe the hostel I was staying at… not exactly sure). Luckily I was able to purchase an accidental protection plan when I got home. This still cost me close to $400, and made be very broke!</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/riga-latvia">Riga</a>, I told a friend that I would get him a souvenir. The shops closed before I made it there, and I didn’t get him the one I wanted to (cool leather covered liquor bottle).</li>
  <li>Somebody stole my €10.00 plastic watch that I bought because I was tired of never knowing what time it was and being late for check out time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/krakow-poland">Krakow</a> I tore my only pair of pants beyond repair… leaving me with one pair of pants. Also, my flip flops broke forcing me to walk in the rain with my right foot continually falling out of the thong.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>I also did cosmetic damage to the second watch that I purchased in <a href="/locations/warsaw-poland">Warsaw</a>… due to losing the first one.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/budapest-hungary">Budapest</a>, we missed another plane, and I think I got bit by bed bugs.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/london-united-kingdom">London</a>, I lost a cool zippo lighter that I bought in the <a href="/locations/prague-czech-republic">Czech Republic</a>.</li>
  <li>I bought a map that my “Lets Go Western Europe” suggested and realized it was worthless, so I traded it for a much cheaper better one.</li>
  <li>The button on my last pair of shorts broke, almost leaving me pants less while going though airport security.</li>
  <li>I lost Trevor in Europe, he decided not to come back with me and is currently in Spain.</li>
  <li>After getting home to <a href="/locations/seattle-washington">Seattle</a>, I lost my cell phone in a taxi.</li>
  <li>I got home, and my computer was broken, I lost my cell phone so I felt very disconnected from life… and realized that somebody stole my bike.</li>
  <li>Finally I lost my financial security. I’ve gone back to donating plasma (first time today in a long time), haven’t bought groceries and am hoping to get paid before my rent is due… other wise I’ll have to figure out something quick</li>
</ul>

<p>Although that is quite a list of lost items, I wouldn’t trade my trip experience for any of it or all of it. It was a truly amazing trip. I really could have made a longer list of all the things I got from the trip, but thought that this was a bit funnier. When / if you have traveled, have you lost, broke or done something else to your stuff.</p>
