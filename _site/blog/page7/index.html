<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2012/12/similarities-of-bounty-hunters-and-mental-health-case-managers">Tuesday December 18, 2012</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/boba-fett-are-case-managers-like-bounty-hunters.gif" alt="Boba Fett coloring page" /> Are mental health case managers like bounty hunters? It is a question in I ask in my blog post  Similarities of Bounty Hunters and Mental Health Case Managers . In thinking about this blog post, it reminded me of the classic bounty hunter, Boba Fett from the original Star War’s Movies. I found the <a href="http://www.thedentedhelmet.com/f34/plain-boba-fett-picture-38441/">coloring page at Star Wars Forum</a>. I embedded it into Adobe Illustrator and had it trace it and expand the tracing. I turned it into a live paint group and colored it in. The text states “Are Mental Health Case Managers Like Bounty Hunters?”</p>

<p>With my drive from Prosser Washington to Pasco twice a day, I’ve been listening to the <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics Podcast</a> (something that you should check out if you haven’t already… it will make you feel smarter). It’s been really interesting, I’m I’ve had a lot of things that I’ve thought about writing about, but just haven’t made time to write about yet. So you get my random thought of the day. The episode I was listening to was titled <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/05/26/freakonomics-radio-the-economics-of-bounty-hunting/">To Catch a Fugitive</a> which is all about the economics of bounty hunters. As always, it was a well put together episode that was informative. They discussed the efficacy and some of the tactics that bounty hunters use.</p>

<p>As I was listening to the podcast, I found myself wondering if I could be a bounty hunter. That led to thoughts of how mental health case managers (i.e. my current position) are like bounty hunters. The most obvious similarity is sometimes the general tasks required. Frequently I find myself trying to track down clients and engage with them. This might mean calling collaterals, going by their homes or places that they hang out, and trying to get them to re-engage in services. This especially true when they have an appointment with our psychiatrist and they haven’t responded to say that they would show for their scheduled appointment.</p>

<p>They discussed that a good bounty hunter will build relationships with police and the community members. This also is true for case managers. I feel like an important part of my job is being the face of <a href="/tags#tcch-bhs">Tri-Cities Community Health</a> in the community, building relationships, networking to be better able to connect clients to resources, and everything in the community.</p>

<p>I find myself, as I am trying to connect people to resources in the community (especially at DSHS), waiting around a lot. This means I need to find ways to be industrious (i.e. making phone calls as I drive with my bluetooth, something else discussed that bounty hunters do) and that much of my job is boring. In the podcast I believe that Bob Burton said that bounty hunting is 90% work and 10% adrenaline. I guess on this point, while I may not be kicking doors down or handcuffing people, there is that 10% that is super exciting and engaging and that reminds me of why I do what I do.</p>

<p>Recently at work, I created a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for a training I did during one of our staff meetings. It is about affecting environmental change and empowerment theory. You can check out the tag Are You Pondering What I’m Pondering Presentation for all of the material that I uploaded regarding this presentation. It was really fun to put together, especially due to the fact that I used the theme of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain">Pinky and the Brain</a>. During my presentation, I even featured the cartoon introduction copied off of YouTube. You can see it below and linked at <a href="http://youtu.be/iJPFSNu_QNs">Pinky and The Brain Intro</a> on YouTube. I created my own background title slide using some coloring page’s I found online (I lost the links to them).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Come along as we live out this conversation … there are many obstacles—so much suffering, poverty and violence. But our God is familiar with suffering. Our God can swallow up armies and pour out bread from the heavens. Wall Street may fail us, but the God who takes care of the lilies and the sparrows will never let us down. Our Savior has stared evil in the face and overcome it with love. And now we are invited to join the triumph of the cross … and to lead others on the narrow, rugged road to freedom.
– From the back cover of the book</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/audiobook-follow-me-freedom-shane-clairborne-john-perkins.jpg" alt="The cover for the Audiobook Version of Shane Claiborn and John Perkins book Follow Me To Freedom: Leading as Ordinary Radicals" class="align-left" /> The cover for the Audiobook Version of Shane Claiborn and John Perkins book Follow Me To Freedom: Leading as Ordinary Radicals ( <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Follow_Me_to_Freedom.html?id=izhsr5SMAyEC">Google Books</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">||</code> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Follow-Me-Freedom-Leading-Ordinary/dp/B003TO6EZO">Amazon</a> ). I uploaded it for my blog post Follow Me to Freedom, Leadership / Followership and Shane Claiborn and John Perkins one of my <a href="/blog?tag=Book%20Review">Book Reviews</a>.</p>

<p>I have really been inspired and encouraged by Shane Claiborn, and you can read my other book review <a href="/blog/2011/12/a-look-into-joining-the-irresistible-revolution">A Look into Joining the Irresistible Revolution</a>. While, I am somewhat familiar with Shane and the <a href="http://www.thesimpleway.org/">Simple Way</a> (the intentional community Shane is involved with), I had not heard of John Perkins before. Interestingly enough, Jamie, my <a href="/blog?tag=TCCH%20BHS">co-worker</a> who lent me a copy of this <a href="/blog?tag=Audio%20Book">audio book</a> does know him.</p>

<p>As I am living a considerable distance from work, read my blog post <a href="/blog/2012/11/when-it-rains-it-pours">When it Rains it Pours</a> for some more information surrounding my move to <a href="/blog?tag=Prosser%20Washington">Prosser</a>, I was able to listen to the whole book in just a little over a week. During my car ride, it monopolized my time, not even leaving very much space for my normally appreciated <a href="/blog?tag=National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a> listening Fervor. I came to find out later about the week (I believe that’s how long she said, but it might have been considerably longer) that spent with John Perkins. She talked about how her time spent with John challenged her perspectives on life and even influenced her later decision to move into the impoverished and underserved community of East Pasco. I also found out from her that he is an 82 year old advocate.</p>

<p>I didn’t read the book itself, so I am not sure how it flowed in its conversational format, but it seemed perfect for the audio format. It’s really structured as more of a conversation between Shane and John and goes back and forth between the two. I’m actually curious how the book displays the differences in voices that were so easily displayed by the portraying authors’ voices.</p>

<p>There were a number of really emboldening stories, [deep thoughts][18], topics that are import to me (<a href="/blog?tag=Community">community</a>, <a href="/resources?tag=Leadership">leadership</a>, how to follow, <a href="/blog?tag=Politics">politics</a>, etc.). Many of the topics addressed came back to relationship and community and how to do community development. The organization, <a href="http://www.ccda.org/">Christian Community Development Association</a>, came up a number of times. It really spoke to me in my position as the chairperson of the <a href="/blog?tag=Pasco%20Discovery%20Coalition">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a>. Some of the methods of organizing these movements, the foundational inclusion of what they call indigenous leaders were all such promising topics. Now it will be trying to figure out how to help guide our coalition in that direction.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend this book, especially in its audio book format for any reader.</p>

  <p>For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on… So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow; will care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
– Jesus in Matthew 6:25-34 in the NASB</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my second year at <a href="http://www.columbiabasin.edu/">Columbia Basin College</a> earning my AA Transfer Degree, I remember being in stress management class. I believe it was the first time that I was exposed to what I have heard over and over in my professional life regarding stress. He discussed a concept of clustering. This could be referred to as chronic or complex stress. This clustering is when an individual experiences a number of stressful events all near the same time period. Both in my life story and so much more in my experience working in mental health over the years, I can really see the truth and frequency that clustering happens.</p>

<p>Over and over in my interactions with my clients, I’ve heard them discuss complex stress even when they don’t understand it as such and only see it as a matter of their daily lives. Working with Medicaid clients and the severely chronically mentally ill at <a href="http://mytcch.org/">Tri-Cities Community Health</a>’s Behavior Health Services Department (<a href="/blog?tag=TCCH%20BHS">Neuva Esperanza Community Counseling Services</a>), unscientifically I would propose that majority of our clients are experiencing the most complex trauma and stress. In thinking about it, I realistically don’t have any client who is only experiencing one major concern in their lives. Their lives tend to be series’ of crises and other problems. As a clinician, it can often times be difficult to discern what their underlying needs are or what issue to work on first.</p>

<p>On Saturday, October 13 Minnie and I were at Tony Romas celebrating the life growing inside of Minnie and getting ready for our baby boy that is expected to come in January 2013. We were completely focused on celebration prep and all of the friends and family that would be attending. I made these pretty snazzy invitations in <a href="/blog?tag=Adobe%20Illustrator">Adobe Illustrator</a>.</p>

<p>We were preparing for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/435036266534789/">baby shower</a> and had both of our families and friends from all over to celebrate at Tony Romas restaurant and to give us baby gifts because we didn’t have anything. As we were celebrating this new upcoming life, we had no idea that Minnie’s mother would pass away in a little over a week. You can check out the photo album, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.705530664176.2100319.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=e976655960">It’s a Boy! Family &amp; Friends Baby Shower</a>, on Facebook. During the baby shower, we had everybody participate in an activity where the guests wrote pieces of advice on a note card for Minnie and I. I really thought this was a cool idea, and wanted to find a great way to share them with everybody. I made a picture collage and a flash object.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/baby-shower-advice-collage.jpg" alt="This is  a collage  I made in  Adobe Photoshop  of the various advice cards we received from our guests we used as an activity during our baby shower." /> This is a collage  I made in Adobe Photoshop of the various advice cards we received from our guests we used as an activity during our baby shower. You can also see the Facebook album. It was inspired by playing around with <a href="http://www.google.com/picasa/">Google’s Picasa Program</a> I realized that I couldn’t make all of the changes I wanted to, so I ended up making it in Photoshop. The Photoshop tools I utilized were pretty basic. Over all of the individual cards, I added a stroke, some inner shadow and some drop shadow. To add a title to the picture, I used a square shape with stroke and pattern overlay. The text of the title just has some drop shadow and utilizes Bradly Hand font. I’ve also <a href="/assets/media/card-collage-baby-shower-advice_0.psd">uploaded the PSD file</a> so you can better see what I did.</p>

<p>The day after the baby shower, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000936035087">Teresa Garcia</a>, Minnie’s mom went ended up going back to the hospital. She had fallen a couple of weeks before, but had not been improving even under her doctors care. While there was a lot of different factors and things that happened, all of which I’m not going to share here, her mother ended up in the Intensive Care Unit at Kadlec Hospital being sustained by life supportive machines. For over a week, Minnie was at the Hospital all day every day with her family and friends. After I would get off work, I’d head to spend time at the hospital too. This gave us a lot of different things to think about and consider.</p>

<p>She and her family had to make decisions about what quality of life is and what her, Teresa Garcia’s, desires would be given her living situation. It was not an easy week with a myriad of other things that came up and difficult situations. Last Monday (10/22/12) the family made the decision to take Minnie’s mother off of life support and she passed away several hours after that. You can see her <a href="http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/obituaries/latestdeathnotices/450832-13/teresa-m-garcia">death notice</a> and her <a href="http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/obituaries/451970-13/teresa-mendez-garcia">obituary</a> in the Yakima Herald.</p>

<p>I took the rest of that week off to be able to be supportive and to help with the arrangements. During this time, we were asked to move in with her father and help to support him in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosser,_WA">Prosser Washington</a>. We packed up all of our stuff and put two thirds of it into a storage unit in Pasco and moved the rest of it to their ranch. This week, I’ve been back a work but it’s been hard to catch back up. Other then moving and all sorts of other crazy stuff… I also got my wisdom teeth pulled (all four of them).</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was listening to an article on <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>’s <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/">Planet Money</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/09/14/161153421/even-if-youre-all-powerful-its-hard-to-fix-the-economy">Even If You’re All-Powerful, It’s Hard To Fix The Economy</a>.The article was all about how difficult it really would be to fix the economy. Using a computer generated model of the United States economy, they try to change various variables associated with the economy to improve it. What they find is that regardless of how many variables they change and how drastically they change those variables… it never gets back as good as it was. It makes me think of the work I do with some of my clients. Often times, when people have psychotic episodes and their mental health deteriorates, they won’t come back to their original baseline of functioning. This is not to say that when somebody experiences a new psychotic break that they can’t improve. But it is like they lose their ability to get back to the same normal that they once had. I guess it is the same for the economy. It almost like in both of those systems, too many things become broken and it becomes very difficult to get back to the same level you were at before.</p>

<p><a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a> is putting on an event, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/248581581927676/">My Friends Place Presents:  Will Work For Food.</a>  I’m really excited.  I started wanting to put on this event several months ago.  I remember thinking about how much of a need in the community there is, but how few kids are actually coming to MFP to stay.  With about 1,500 teens in the Tri-Cities have been homeless at some point in their lives, according to national statistics… I can’t imagine any reasons why we should ever be empty. It’s gonna be a really amazing event. We are having four DJ’s coming and doing their show.</p>

<p>This design project was created for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/my.friends.place.kennewick">My Friends Place</a>’s Event, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/248581581927676/">Will Rage for Food</a>.  I made it in <a href="/blog?tag=Adobe%20PhotoShop">Adobe Photoshop</a>.  I got some of the images through a Google Image Search.  I took the <a href="http://drake.marin.k12.ca.us/staff/doherty/djclub.htm">DJ Mixer</a> and <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/70874295/thigh-high-sparkle-fur-gogo-fluffies">the Girl</a>, but I made everything else. The following are the images associated with this event</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/tom-rath-strengths-finder-2.0-book-cover.jpg-book-cover.jpg" alt="Tom Rath's Strengths Finder 2.0 Book Cover" class="align-right" /> Tom Rath’s Strengths Finder 2.0 Book Cover.  You can read Developing Strengths, Tim Roth’s Strengths Finder 2.0 Review.</p>

<p>I’m currently helping out at my agency, <a href="/blog?tag=TCCH%20BHS">Nueva Esperanza Community Counseling Services</a>, with a working group redesigning out treatment plan that we use with our client.  It’s been a good process and I think something important to consider.  In participating in this process, I have been thinking about how we develop strengths.  I decided that since I was thinking about strengths perspective, I should put up some information in my <a href="/resources">resources section</a>.</p>

<p>I also recently finished reading a copy of Tom Roth’s Strengths Finder 2.0 (make sure to check out all of my other <a href="/blog?tag=Book%20Review">book reviews</a>).  I’d recommend the book, but I will acknowledge that it takes some homework time to really gain any significance from it.</p>

<p>To really get the most out of Strengths Finder 2.0, you must purchase a new copy of the book (or a book that has an unused access code for their website).  The book really is only supplemental, and I felt like it was almost like a sales pitch for their web program to examine individuals strengths.  The majority of the learning I accomplished seemed to come from using their <a href="http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx">Clifton Strengths Finder</a>.   This is basically an assessment that attempts to help you discover what strengths and assets you have have though choosing answers on a web based form.</p>

<p>I did find the results to be valuable, and informative.  I also really appreciated hearing about a strengths perspective from a different source (i.e. not just about mental health, but seeing the value in the business / personal life).  It’s been an interesting couple of months reading (don’t worry, it didn’t take me a couple of months to finish this book, as it’s quite small).  I’ve also been reading Plato’s The Republic.  While I haven’t finished, I hope to within the next couple of weeks, so you can look forward to a review of that book too.  But to give you a small look forward, I’ve been amazed how many theories and modern ideas are espoused in Plato’s work, including strengths perspective.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2012/4/pasco-discovery-coalition-logo-ideas">Sunday April 22, 2012</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>I am very lucky at <a href="/blog?tag=TCCH%20BHS">my job</a>, to be able to be a part of a some community organizing.  I have started to be involved with meetings associated with the <a href="http://www.dshs.wa.gov/pdf/dbhr/Pasco%20PRI%20Brochure-%20Final.pdf">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a>.  I’ve just started, so I am very much in the learning phase of participating in their coalition, but I believe it will be a valuable learning experience.  While we were at our last meeting, they had mentioned that somebody was working on a website for them, and it got me thinking about a logo.  Teresa (the current co-chair) described that she has been using geese flying in a “V” formation as their logo.  She said that it was based on how birds will have different birds fly as the lead bird at different times, and how much better they are are able to fly together.</p>

<p>Nobody had asked me to make a Logo, and I am not even sure if they really need one, but I like pushing myself and learning a little bit more about graphic design, so I decided to throw some of these designs out there.  I wouldn’t call any of them finished products, but it was interesting for me to work on.  Some of them I like, some of them I don’t (I posted all of them, so you could see my design process).</p>
