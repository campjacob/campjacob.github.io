<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2011/11/busy-weekend-of-drinks-fundraisers-and-outreaches">Monday November 21, 2011</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/fundraiser-tree-teens-living-glass-house.jpeg" alt="Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery Beggars' 2011  was a wonderful event this year. Every year they have a large selection of Christmas Trees as silent auction items. This is one of those trees titled " /> Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery Beggars’ 2011 was a wonderful event this year. Every year they have a large selection of Christmas Trees as silent auction items. This is one of those trees titled “Homeless Teens Live in Glass Houses.” I’m guessing it is inspired by My Friends Place.</p>

<p>The last several days have been very busy. We (Minnie and I)went to the monthly Young Professionals of the Tri-Cities social night out, a fundraiser for Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery, hung out with great friends at Twigs, helped pass out fliers and food to teens, Minnie’s dad’s 61st birthday dinner and her friends birthday party, went to church, and got my car fixed. Like I said, a busy couple of days.</p>

<p>I haven’t participated with the <a href="http://youngprofessionalstc.org/">Young Professionals of Tri-Cities</a>. It’s a good organization. I have made a lot of different connections and it’s a great way the community. If you are interested in participating in YPTC you can check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/228984918463/">YPTC Facebook Groups</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Young-Professionals-Tri-Cities-WA/109036925794205">YPTC Facebook Page</a>. We went to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/307191105957788/">Nov. After-Hours Social</a>. It was at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ZINFUL-Panini-Grill-Wine-Bar/111441516616?sk=info">ZINFUL Panini Grill &amp; Wine Bar</a>. It has a old fashioned feel. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I also enjoyed the company. The YPTC meetings generally are about meeting everybody, talking about our professions and what we are currently involved with. It’s always a good time.</p>

<p>The YPTC event was on Thursday. On Friday evening (after a busy day at work), we went strait to the Beggars Banquet 2011. This event is one of my favorite fundraisers that I attend yearly. They started doing it several years ago, and it was made up of a couple of dozen people inside <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a>. For the last couple of years they have been having the event at the <a href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/">The Three Rivers Convention Centers</a>. It is a venue that can host 750 people. They packed it. I haven’t had a chance to find out how well the event did this year, but it looked like it went well. It’s a really fun event, that not only has both a live and silent auction, but it has a soup tasting contest. <a href="http://www.atomicalebrewpub.com/">Atomic Ale Brewpub &amp; Eatery</a> won with their Atomic Ale’d Red Potato Soup. As the evening wore on with the live auction (which seemed to do really well with a professional auctioneer), we along with Charlie and Christine. We decided that it must be time for a couple of drinks. We decided to go to the new coolest martini bar, <a href="http://www.twigsbistro.com/twigs-bistro-kennewick-location">Twigs Bistro &amp; Martini Bar</a>. I must say, the hype (which I’ve heard a lot of people talking about it) is true. I’ve been to their locations in Spokane, but it’s nice to have something as classy in the Tri-Cities.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/my-friends-place-sign.jpg" alt="  My Friends Place  is a project of Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery. It is the first shelter going to be opened in the Tri-Cities for homeless teenagers. " /> My Friends Place  is a project of Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery. It is the first shelter going to be opened in the Tri-Cities for homeless teenagers.</p>

<p>The other thing that it is nice to have in the Tri-Cities is a shelter for homeless teens (My Friends Place). You can read more about on my blog post for <a href="/blog/2011/10/the-lawyers-artists-ball-2011-for-my-friends-place">The Lawyers &amp; Artists Ball 2011 for My Friends Place</a>. Saturday morning we went and picked up fliers and survival kits. We went around Kennewick looking for teens to talk to and hand out stuff too. While (I think due to the snow) we didn’t meet up with many kids, we did talk to quite a few. We got the opportunity to hear some peoples experiences. We met a girl who was a little bit older, but was pending homeless. She described that she has been having a lot of problems lately. We tried to share some resources with her. We met another lady who told us about her son that had committed suicide a couple of years ago, but had been homeless himself. When you feel like your not doing very much (i.e. passing out fliers or something), it’s hard to recognize how much of an impact you can have. All of the other teens that we met said they knew people that needed it.</p>

<p>After being touched be the people we met, we went to he Yakima Valley for two Birthday parties. The next morning we went to <a href="http://www.eastlaketricities.com/Default.aspx">Eastlake Tri-Cities</a>. It was the second time we’ve gone there, and we really like it.</p>

You can view the book on Amazon.</p>

<p>As I generally do, I was listening to National Public Radio (my driving companion when I’m not listing to gangster rap) and I first heard a story <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131166027">Hedges Laments The ‘Death Of The Liberal Class’</a>. I was struck listening to Hodges talk about his life and the liberal class. It was a soon after that that I ended up being at <a href="http://g.co/maps/35gkx">Barnes &amp; Nobel</a> and quickly bought the book when I saw it. You must understand that this is about a year (I don’t know why it took me so long to read it, it was really good), and I was spending a lot of time at anywhere that had wireless internet.</p>

<p>I started reading it for a while, and then I put it down for a while, but kept picking it back up. Don’t let the fact that it took me a year to read cause you to believe that it’s not a good book. It was very engrossing, educational, and inspirational in its own way. He goes from describing what the liberal class was originally, to how it has been dismantled and loss of the processes which used to inhabit and permit the class. My favorite chapter is the one on liberal defectors, because I feel it is always so powerful to hear peoples stories. The final chapter is about titled rebellion and encourages the reader to rebel against the system.</p>

<p>Other then the topics and information of the book, I especially enjoyed Hodges vocabulary. The following some of the words that were new to me (although in my little book there were a lot more that I wrote down):</p>

<p>While there is a lot of people much smarter then me that discuss what the significance of the Dry Bones Prophesy is in Ezekiel. I’m not claiming that God was talking about the liberal class (although that is kind of a funny thought due to how conservative some Christians appear to be. But I do think it is a very visual scene that could portray where the the liberal class is as Hodges describes it.</p>

<p>It is a book that I would highly recommend to read. I think it is timely right now, too. While it was written prior to the <a href="http://www.occupytogether.org/">Occupy Wall street Movement</a> but I think that it is along the same lines.</p>

I absolutely loved it…hopefully some day, I can make artwork of a similar quality.</p>

<p>On Saturday, I got the opportunity to attend <a href="http://myfriendsplace.info/">My Friends Place’s</a> Fundraiser called the Lawyer’s and Artist’s Ball 2011. It was a pretty amazing event. I have been lucky to be able to be on the committee to start My Friends Place (you can also check out the <a href="http://www.causes.com/causes/611545-myfriendsplace">My Friends Place Cause Page</a>. My Friends Place is both a non-profit organization and a program of <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a>. It has been quite a process and I have been loving the opportunity to be a part of something big and a great need for our community!The event went wonderfully. There were tons of great costumes and I think we raised a lot of money. You can check out the photos I took (I wish I had taken more) in my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.601596444186.2084849.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=6151ac05cd">Facebook Album Lawyer’s &amp; Artist’s Ball 2011 Album</a>. It was impacting to hear the story one man told about his son who recently died… but had previously been homeless. We found out that he and his family had donated $10,000.00, which is enough to open the doors as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As my avid blog readers (I think with all the time my site was down, there are probably none… LOL) probably already know I love <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a>. I’m always listening to it in the car all day (unless I’m bumping some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(entertainer)">Drake</a>). Last night as I was getting off work, late as normal, and driving home. NPR had a really amazing story on. It was <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/25/141672992/native-foster-care-lost-children-shattered-families"><em>Native Foster Care: Lost Children, Shattered Families</em></a>. It was very informative and powerful. I think I teared up a little bit.As I was driving home, and being impacted by this powerful story, it reminded me of what one of my professors told us one time. We were watching some pretty upsetting videos, and she (<a href="http://www.ewu.edu/CSBSSW/Programs/Social-Work/Social-Work-Faculty/Mary-Ann-Clute.xml">Mary Ann Clute</a>) told us the day that hearing some of these stories no longer effect us is the day we should change professions. I guess listening to to this story makes me realize that I really am still in the right profession.That’s a great big “Job Well Done” to me.</p>

<p>If your curious about what the percentage of Native American Children are in the foster care system in your state, check out the map below or <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/25/141475618/disproportionality-rates-of-native-american-children-in-foster-care">Disproportionality Rates of Native American Children In Foster Care</a>.</p>

<p>I have been been doing graphic and web design stuff for the last several years. It all started with an original blogspot website . My friends all started posting blogs and I created my own. Later I learned that I wanted to change how the blog looked and felt. I started teaching myself a little bit both doing some of my own graphical design and webdesign. After a while, I figured I wanted greater control and to create my own website. I used some free space from my ISP. I out grew that, and decided I wanted greater control over my site and the ability to employ <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>. I purchased my own web hosting and domain name. I built a pretty extensive website using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> as my blog software and creating static PHP pages with different functioning. After going through my entire website and having to update a few things a couple of times, I decided it was time to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_System">CMS</a>. I started using <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> as a CMS. I spent a lot of time, and had placed all of my static pages onto Drupal’s system and designed it how I liked it. I started to learn to change some basic structural components of the system to the way I liked it. Then Drupal upgraded to a complete new version. Since I am always looking for the newest greatest thing, I upgraded my site. I lost all of my data as it was structured in the process. I have all of the backup files, but I can’t just import it. I lost a couple of hundred pages and my blog articles. I’m especially sad, because I had recorded many of my travels through Europe and South America. I’m hoping to make this site better then it was before and with more enhancements. My website was down for a long time, and now I’m starting fresh… I won’t lie. It will probably take me quite a while to get back to where I was before, but I will work on it. I hope you enjoy what you find and I always appreciate comments.</p>

<p>Life has been busy lately, and I haven’t posted anything for a while. Most of my time has been taken up by working. I’m working as a Mental Health Case Manager at Nueva Esperanza a part of <a href="http://www.tcc-health.org/ (Tri-Cities Community Health)">Tri-Cities Community Health</a>. I have been really loving it. I’ve gotten lots of cool opportunities working there, and am learning a lot.</p>

<p>I’ve still been working at <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org (Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery)">Safe Harbor</a>. Next month, I will be starting to lead a group for pre-teens / teens. I’m pretty excited about it.</p>

<p>I also got to go to the social night out for <a href="http://www.youngprofessionalstc.org/ (Young Professionals of the Tri-Cities)">Young Professionals of the Tri-Cities</a>. It was nice to meet so many people of different organizations. I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to have some changes come to my website here in the near future.</p>

<p>On Friday, I got the opportunity to go to <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org (Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery)">Safe Harbor’s</a> annual Beggars Banquet. It was a really great event, and so much bigger then I’ve seen it. It had been several years since I was able to go to the last event, and it has changed drastically and really gave me some great prospective on doing some fundraising events. Years ago, when I last went they were in the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vqtv (Google Maps, Old Country Buffet)">Old Country Buffet</a>, maybe had a 100 people, and made something like $5,000. A lot has changed since I’ve come back to the Tri-Cities.</p>

<p>This years event, and last years for that matter, took place at the <a href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/ (Three Rivers Convention Center)">Three Rivers Convention Center</a>, a wonderful venue. The main feature of this annual event is local restaurants bring in their best soup. The event drew about 800 participants this year and a small army of volunteers. Volunteers even included Miss Tri-Cities and Miss Columbia Basin. I spent my time volunteering taking pictures of the event (although I didn’t load them on my laptop, so I’m not posting any as of yet). There was a silent auction of gift baskets and beautifully decorated Christmas trees. There was also a live auction of lots of cool items, with the hottest selling item being one of the board members preparing a five different dinners for groups of 8 people selling for I believe $500 a pop. Pretty amazing. They also had a number of drawings, raffles, and even a card game. They’ve really come up with some innovative ways of getting money, with even just a live donation time at the end. This year, before paying for all of the events costs, they came up with about $50,000, which is absolutely amazing! That’s about $20,000 more then they made the previous year.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks have been pretty great. This last weekend was really fun. I got the opportunity to go to the 2010 Tri-Cities Wine Festival held at the <a href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/ (Three Rivers Convention Center)">Three Rivers Convention Center</a>. It was a really fabulous event. While the entrance was generally $65.00 to attend, I was able to get in for free. <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/ (Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery)">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a> was invited to the event to do a coat check for donations. I was able to go and spend a little bit of time tasting some wines before starting to collect coats. It was a lot of fun. When I was walking around (by myself at first), I ended up meeting two people. One was a lady from China who had gotten her Ph.D. from <a href="http://wsu.edu/ (Washington State University)">WSU</a> and a guy who was from Chile. I was really surprised to meet a couple of international persons in the Tri-Cities (I always feel like it’s such a small place). Especially the guy from Chile. We spent time talking about Pisco, and the rivalry between Peru and Chile. It was very interesting.</p>

<p>When I was doing the coat check it was kind of fun. I got to talk about Safe Harbor with a number of people and hear lots of people say they were familiar with our services. We even had a guy give a $100 donation into our tip jar. Pretty phenomenal.</p>

<p>I get to go into my orientation here tomorrow for Tri-Cities Community Health. It seems like things are getting into place.</p>
