<p><img src="/assets/media/antique-open-sign.gif" alt="I found this great open sign at  Legendary Antiques website .  I figured it would be good for this post. " class="align-left" /> I found this great open sign at Legendary Antiques website .  I figured it would be good for this post.</p>

<p>If you know me very well you know I have a lot of stuff I’m invovled with. Sometimes feel a little bit like I’m <a href="http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/erich-brenn-plate-spinner">Erich Brenn</a>, and I’m trying to keep all of my plates spinning. The following is the short list of plates I’ve got in the air right now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being a new dad / family (so much fun, but tiring too)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mytcch.org/">Tri-Cities Community Health</a> (my day job)</li>
  <li>Teaching at <a href="http://www.heritage.edu">Heritage University</a></li>
  <li>Acting as the chair person for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pascodiscoverycoalition/">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a> (like us on <a href="http://fb.com/PascoDiscoveryCoalition">Facebook</a></li>
  <li>Being involved at our <a href="http://eastlaketricities.com">church</a></li>
  <li>Various volunteer and community activities that come up, especially at <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org">Safe Harbor</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/my.friends.place.kennewick">My Friends Place</a></li>
  <li>Attending and <a href="/blog/2013/11/speaking-of-speaking-a-busy-week">speaking</a> at the <a href="http://www.macusergroup.com">MC Mac User Group</a></li>
  <li>I’m working on getting my LICSW, hopefully by the end of next year… maybe then doing a small amount of private practice work.</li>
  <li>Being a geek and reading, playing with all things technology and productivity related</li>
  <li>I’d still like to write my book, and have made some limited progress</li>
  <li>Being social, spending time with family and friends</li>
</ul>

<p>With all of these plates spinning, I figured it was time that I take my extra curricular activities to the next level. I applied and was approved today for a <a href="http://bls.dor.wa.gov/LicenseSearch/lqsLicenseDetail.aspx?RefID=334735">small business license for the state of Washington</a>. It’s starting as a sole proprietor ownership style, and I am calling it <strong>Locus of Transformation</strong>. The plan is to also get licensed in the City of Pasco, so I’m hopping to take in my application tomorrow sometime. I do have some plans and hopes for this currently, but I’m not really ready to share those yet. I’m am sure that it is something that will be also evolving over time, and I’m very sure I’ll be sharing more as things progress. I chose the name, because I feel like all of the different activities, organization, and people I even work with individually I really desire to be a point of change.</p>

<p>So, while I don’t have anything currently going yet, and defiantly not any revenue streams yet… I am officially a small business owner. I did make a logo. It’s still a work in progress, but I figure it’s a good start. I’d love any feedback.</p>

<p>This last week has been incredibly busy for me, but it’s also been very good. On Tuesday I had two major speaking activities to prepare for. At work, <a href="http://www.mytcch.org/behavioral.php">Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services</a>, we are starting a group on <a href="http://www.loveandlogic.com/">Becoming Parents with Love and Logic</a>. We haven’t done groups for a while, and I’ve never facilitated this course before, so I spent most of the weekend getting ready for the group. It went really well. That evening I had another event I was speaking at.</p>

<p>Almost a year ago, I transitioned to using a mac. A couple of months ago, i found out about these things called <a href="https://www.apple.com/usergroups/">mac user groups</a>. It’s kind of geeky, but it has been kind of cool. <a href="http://www.macusergroup.com">The Mid Columbia Macintosh User Group</a> meets in Kennewick. I’ve been very lucky to speak at a lot of events, regarding a lot of topics. This was the first time that I’ve been able to talk to about technology stuff. I’m hoping to have more opportunities in the future. You can download a copy my <a href="/assets/media/brief-overview-alfred-keynotekey.zip">Overview of Alfred Keynote</a> from my presentation or see it below.</p>

<p>On Thursday the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pascodiscoverycoalition/">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a> did a Town Hall and Resource Fair Event at Ochoa Middle School. It was pretty great. We had about 37 different community organizations! It was fun to prepare for and to put on.

<p>Tonight is Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery’s <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/index.php/latest-news/25-beggars-banquet-2013">Beggars Banquet</a>. Work has been absolutely beyond crazy busy for me, so it’s been a pretty crazy week. We decided not to go tonight, which is too bad, because it would have been a great event.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/Mateo+the+Old+Man-+DIY+Old+Man+Halloween+Costume.png" alt=" Mateo the Old Man: DIY Old Man Halloween Costume " /> Mateo the Old Man: DIY Old Man Halloween Costume</p>

<p>I spent the last couple of weeks searching in google images for the perfect costume for Mateo’s first halloween costume. I found a great idea, dress Mateo up like an old man. I ended up coming across, [Best Toddler Costume: Carl from “Up”] (http://www.geekinheels.com/2011/11/10/best-toddler-costume-carl-from-up.html). <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/">UP (2009)</a> is a fantastic movie. While Mateo’s costume, wasn’t meant to imitate Carl like the aforementioned link, we decided on just an old man.</p>

<p>You can see some of photos I took of Mateo and the putting the walker together below. We ended up doing our photo shoot with Mateo this weekend (a week after halloween). Mateo wasn’t having any pictures the day of. You can also see the album, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.815629415396&amp;type=1&amp;l=becece9307">Old Man Mateo, Halloween 2013</a>.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a cute costume. I made the walker from PVC pipe (I cut five 2 ft lengths and two 18 in lengths. I bought and returned PVC cement. I decided the pipe fit snug enough that it wouldn’t be necessary. The following are is the list of supplies that I bought and what prices I found for them at Target / Lowes.</p>

<p>A video I made in <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/">iMovie</a> from my <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone 5</a> Video Camera. It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Away_(Lenny_Kravitz_song">Lenny Kravitz Fly Away</a>) for the music and features Mateo trying to escape from our home.</p>

<p>After taking Mateo’s 10 moth pictures, I filed this movie and edited it with iMovie. It was kind of fun, and didn’t take more then a couple of hours. The Monthly Photo Project has been kind of a fun project and we are getting close to the tail end of it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/Automator-and-AppleScript-Header-Image.jpg" alt=" A Header Image I created for my blog article about my playing with automator &amp; AppleScript " /> A Header Image I created for my blog article about my playing with automator &amp; AppleScript</p>

<p>I’ve never really been a programmer, but I always have been a geek. One thing that I think is kind of cool about my transition from Windows to a Mac has been a lot of the utilities. One utility that I have tried a couple of times to play with, but I haven’t found an interesting enough use (or been able to figure out how to do uses that I did want to do). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software">Automator</a>) on the Mac is a pretty powerful application. Doing some research, there could be some applications that could be downloaded used in Windows, but nothing built in like automator and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Services_menu">services</a>.</p>

<p>There have been several times that <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a> has talked about automator, but specifically <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2012/01/22/mpu-070-working-with-automator/">MPU 070: Working with Automator</a>. Its good, and a great Podcast if your interested.</p>

<p>Another application that I have been loving has been <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>. For some reason, with all of my popup select features (I think it’s because I’m syncing it with <a href="http://www.phraseexpress.com/">Phrase Express</a> on Windows). I created a service which uses an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript">AppleScript</a> which searches copied text for the “<code class="highlighter-rouge">|</code>” and replaces it with “:” a pretty simple apple script is below (Its probably not very efficient, but it’s my first one.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>on replace_chars(this_text, search_string, replacement_string)
        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to the search_string
        set the item_list to every text item of this_text
        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to the replacement_string
        set this_text to the item_list as string
        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ""
        return this_text
    end replace_chars
    
    
    set the message_text to get the clipboard
    set the message_text to replace_chars(message_text, "|", ":")
    
    return message_text
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/media/mateo-campbell-fall-great-pumpkin.jpg" alt=" It's The Great Pumpkin Mateo Campbell " /> It’s The Great Pumpkin Mateo Campbell</p>

<p>Holiday’s can always be remembered by what Charlie Brown Special was aired for them. A Halloween favorite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_the_Great_Pumpkin,_Charlie_Brown (Wikipedia Article:  The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown)">It’s The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown</a>. If you are in a reminiscingessing mood, you can watch the entire episode below.</p>

<p>While it’s not quite Halloween yet, fall is in full swing. I have mixed emotions about fall. I always say that I would prefer the heat to cold weather… I do really enjoy sweaters and the security they bring. This halloween we do have another thing to look forward to, but I don’t want to over sell it yet. I’m pretty sure the costume idea we have for Mateo will be a giant hit. All I’m going to say for now is that “Adventure is out there!”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/country-mercantile-pasco-sign-harvest.jpg" alt=" The Country Mercantile " /> The Country Mercantile</p>

<p>Another joy of the impending fall season is Harvest Events. Earlier today Minnie, Mateo, and I all went to the <a href="http://www.countrymercantile.com/ (Country Mercantile)">Country Mercantile</a>. Mateo was being a little bit grumpy. Normally he is just a ham for the camera, but today we only got a few good smiles out of them. The Country Mercantile is a generally cool store and always worth the drive to get some ice cream. Especially if you have kids that are toddlers or older, the $6.50 entrance fee is well worth it. There were a ton of great activities that Mateo is just not quite old enough to participate in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fair style food booths</li>
  <li>Amusement park rides</li>
  <li>Petting zoo</li>
  <li>Mountain of hay play area</li>
  <li>Hay bale maze for toddlers</li>
  <li>Corn maze</li>
  <li>Hay bale ride</li>
  <li>Enormous pumpkin patch</li>
</ul>

<p>When we went to the petting zoo (pretty small selection of animals, but cool non the less), they had a feisty cow. We were trying to introduce Mateo to the cow, when he started introducing himself to Mateo. With the cows Moo, Mateo started balling and completely freaked out. I think he was overwhelmed by the smells and new sounds.</p>

<p>I’m really looking forward to when he is a bit older, and can run around some. It seemed like it would be such a great place for him to run around and play. This is particularly true for the little toddler maze and the giant hay bale pyramid. Maybe next year, and hopefully it won’t start to rain again.</p>

<p>Having my iPhone close, you know that I took a plethora of photos. I am really enjoying the square aspect shots (like Instagram) and the photo filters that are built in for iOS 7. I even got to play around with the panorama shot. Anyways, I’ll upload some of the pictures to the gallery below, but you can check out the rest of the photos on <a href="http://fb.com/jacobshouse">Facebook</a> in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.805817189176.1073741828.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=19d7058778">The Great Pumpkin Mateo Campbell</a>.</p>

<h2 id="change-in-website">Change in Website</h2>

<p>I figured that I would start off by saying that I’m not a professional web designer, although I have done it and graphic design on occasions professionally. For the past couple of years I have been using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a> called <a href="https://drupal.org">Drupal</a>. There was a time when I was really enjoying learning some PHP and coding techniques. As my life has gotten busier and now more family oriented… I haven’t had as much time to keep updating it.</p>

<p>Many of the Podcasts that I like listening too, kept advertising SquareSpace. It’s has been pretty easy to set up and is fairly flexible. I am missing how my site previously looked, and I still haven’t been able to add all of my previous content in yet… so it is still a work in progress. I still have my previous website running <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com">http://jacobrcampbell.com/</a> and this post will even in the future likely be placed there, but for now I’m using <a href="http://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com">http://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com</a>. I’ve decided that updating and keeping up the Drupal version of my website is too much work. The last couple of months, I haven’t even been able to log into my site. I think there is some sort of problem with the tables, that i just don’t have the expertise to fix. I’ve been trying to find a programmer who is familiar with Drupal site development, and have been unable to.</p>

<p>I’ve decided that my primary purpose for having a website is to be able to write, especially here on my blog. Maybe some day I will want to go back to something more like Drupal, but for the now the overhead is just too much (not to mention that I still can’t log in and update my website currently…). I’ve been spending some time transferring old articles and blog posts to my new site, but I decided that I do want to continue to post some new content even as I am going through this traditional phase.</p>

<h2 id="giant-growth-chart">Giant Growth Chart</h2>

<p>One thing that I have been wanting to post about for a while was a DYI project that I after moving into our new house. I created a giant growth chart to be able to track Mateo’s growth. It was a pretty fun project. I went to Lowes and bought a 12’ by 8” board. I sanded it down (60, 80, 120 grits) and stained it to match our hard wood floors. After attaching it to the wall, we have been attaching photos of Mateo as he has been getting taller. I had decided that I wanted to do it with pictures and I thought about a lot of different ways to attach pictures. The following is what I did.</p>

<p>I bought a bunch of metal refrigerator magnets. I removed the magnet part along with the casing for it. I screwed in at the height that Mateo was when the photo was taken the clip to the wood. We took a bunch of pictures and posted the best ones to <a href="http://instagram.com/campjacb">Instagram</a> with information about the date, and age of Mateo. I printed them for 36 cents at Walgreens through their iPhone app and picked them up. I think it’s been turing out pretty great. I figured that Minnie and I had to be on the chart too… even though we won’t be growing any more.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2013/6/jacob-the-not-so-mad-scientist">Tuesday June 18, 2013</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/toy-house-laying-on-side.jpg" alt="This is a photo that I took of one of the toy’s that Mateo always throws on the ground while Minnie and I are sitting at the table and eating dinner." class="align-right" /> This is a photo that I took of one of the toy’s that Mateo always throws on the ground while Minnie and I are sitting at the table and eating dinner.</p>

<p>As a mental health counselor, I feel that I have a pretty good grasp one how to raise my son, and what to do. Something I feel like I explain to parents frequently when they bring their kids in, especially young kids, is that the majority of the counseling I’m going to do is with them. I explain that they are with their children and have so much more powerful of an impact then I ever could in the hour a couple of times a month I get to see them.</p>

<p>I feel like with my education and experience, I have been able to discuss some pretty sound points with parents and work through some issues well. That being said, as I go into raising Mateo, it’s like everything is an experiment right now. Hopefully Mateo won’t feel too much like I’ve been experimenting on him when he gets older, but I figure we are in it together to find the best solutions to everything that comes up.</p>

<p>A couple of nights ago, Minnie and I were sitting eating dinner and Mateo was in his high chair (already having eaten). He kept throwing his little barn on the ground. I decided that I didn’t want to pick it up every couple of minutes. I know that he doesn’t have the fine motor control to really manipulate objects and move things around very well. He also get super excited and starts flailing his arms around (so cute). <strong>I am not saying that I was upset with him, or even view this as anything but normal baby behavior</strong>, that being said, I did say I’ve been experimenting on him (<em>not in any bad way</em>). I decided that every time he knocks his toys off his high chair, I will pick it up. I will show it to him and tell him that he supposed to keep it on the table (pointing to the table) and then put it on our table for him to look at for about a minute (I tell him that I will give it back to him after a minute). He’s a pretty content baby and doesn’t seem to mind losing his toy too much right now. After about a minute, I give the toy back to him and explain again that he can play with it, but not to throw it on the ground or he will lose it again for another minute.</p>

<p>All that being said, it’s a pretty simple exercise, and some classical conditioning. It does seem to be working some. While he still throws it on the ground or knocks it over, I feel like he is more careful with it now, as if he knows that he want’s to keep playing with it. Like I said, pretty simple little thing… but it does give me a bit of the mad scientist feeling of trying to figure out what works best. I just figured I’d share…</p>

<p>Also, today is Mateo’s Six Month Birthday! We completed our monthly photo shoot so I will be posted a lot of shots on <a href="http://instagram.com/campjacob">Instagram</a>, so make sure you check them out.</p>
