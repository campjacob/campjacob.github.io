<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2008/8/prague-so-many-statues-and-beautiful-streets">Monday August 25, 2008</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>Our stay in Prague has been a blur of beautiful tours of the various sites, long walks back and forth to our hostel, late night to early morning going out, cathedrals and castles. All in all a great trip.</p>

<p>Our first day we went to the [<a href="http://www.nm.cz/index.php?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2">Národní Muzeum</a> <a href="http://www.nm.cz/index.php?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2">National Museum</a>. We did not buy a camera pass so, there are no pictures from the inside. It was full of a zoological history of the world. So many ancient and modern species were represented. there was also history about the Czech Republic and their decent from communism and Russia. It was a very informative museum, although much of it was only in Czech. We spent much of the remainder of the day wondering around the winding streets of old Prague. I find the area to be very confusing. The buildings tower over the cobblestone streets. The old rock streets wind in and out of each other (changing names every few blocks) and never following a set grid. We found our way to [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Astronomical_Clock">the Astronomical Clock</a> in the town center. From the top you can see over the entire city (the top picture is taken from here, and shows the Prague Castle). After wondering around the town all day, we made it back to the Hostel about 20:00.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/photo-prague-cz-charles-bridge-crowd.jpg" alt="Crowd on Charles Bridges in Prague" /> Crowd on Charles Bridges in Prague</p>

<p>At the hostel there was a group of travelers getting ready to go out on a Pub Crawl. Neither me or Trevor had heard or been on a Pub Crawl before. The idea is that Travelers from all over (various hostels) all meet together at a specified location. Then they pay a local to get “free drinks” for the first hour and then to be taken to the cities best clubs. We found this to be a great way to meet people. About 10 people from our hostel went and we met up with about 50 other people. It was a pretty fun evening. Me and Marcelo (a guy from Brazil) didn’t get back until about 5:30 am.</p>

<p>After living up the night life in Prague, I woke up to go and see some more of the sites. Me and Trevor traveled to the other side of the river heading towards the Prague Castle. Along the way, there were a number of neat shops and amazing views. We crossed over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge">Charles Bridge</a> which was jam packed full of people, street vendors, artists, and musicians. On the other side of the Charles Bridge we found the greatest statue that we found (and we saw a lot). I guess it might be a little mature, so don’t play it if you are easily offended;</p>

The Czech Crown Jewels are kept here</p>

<p>We wondered up to the Prague Castle, which really was more of a old Cathedral. Positioned at the top of the hill just behind Prague, it gave a breath taking view of the old city. Standing in line waiting go to hear some of the history of this building and about the Gargoyles that rest around the edge. After wondering around the Castle it was back to the Hostel to meet up with some people. We went out with some girls from Ireland… and had a pretty relaxed evening. The morning came too early and with that time to check out. Our bus leaves for Munich Germany at 23:55 and arrives at 05:30. hopefully we will be able to sleep on the bus. As for the rest of the day, I see us just spending time relaxing.</p>

<p>Facebook is currently not letting me upload the pictures… I will post links after it starts to work.</p>

<p>As promised, we did go to <a href="http://g.co/maps/nj846">Prague</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">in Czech “Praha”</a>). It took 6 and a half hours to travel there by bus. We spent the morning wondering around the bus depot. Upon arriving in Prague, we figured out where we were fairly quickly. But we ended up wondering around in the rain until about 1:30 in the morning. We also talked to three different hostels. Our 16 person dorm room in the <a href="http://www.hostelmarabou.com/en/node/9">Hostel Marabou</a> is pretty nice.</p>

<p>The last two days seem to blur together some. I am coming to understand that my days here in Europe will be very full and have all sorts of different activities. The day before yesterday, we again stayed at the <a href="http://www.meininger-hotels.com/en/hotel-hostel/hotelsearch/berlin/central-station/">Meininger Hostel</a>, and hung out some with our dorm mate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30718436&amp;l=8a276&amp;id=44504407">Carlos</a>. We spent a considerable amount of time walking all over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a>. I have since become fairly familiar and able to navigate my way around. This is especially true in regards to the subway / train system. It’s pretty easy to follow once you get the hang of it. We visited Märkisches Museum‎ (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode&amp;view=map&amp;q=M%C3%A4rkisches+Museum%E2%80%8E+Berlin+Germany&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.519668%2C13.413448&amp;spn=0.022875%2C0.064373&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A">Märkisches Museum‎ Google Places Page</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">||</code> <a href="http://www.berlinstadtservice.de/xinh/Maerkische_Museum_Berlin.html">Märkisches Museum‎ Website</a>). They had wonderful exhibits depicting ancient history in Germany and Berlin. No photographs permitted though, or else I would prove that they used to have moose in Germany. They also had an exhibit showing the history of lights in Berlin.</p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/assets/media/gedenkst%C3%A4tte-berliner-mauer-berlin-germany-wall.jpg" alt=" A photo of the Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer memorial to the hundreds of people that might have died trying to cross the wall, and the thousands who suffered major disruption to their lives." class="align-center" /> A photo of the Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer memorial to the hundreds of people that might have died trying to cross the wall, and the thousands who suffered major disruption to their lives.</p>

<p>After eating some dinner we started to make our way back to the Hostel. We decided to attempt to stop at all the various bars and restaurants for a drink till we made it back to the Hostel. One interesting bar / club that we stopped at was <a href="http://www.whitetrashfastfood.com/">White Trash Fast Food</a>. It was interesting seeing maybe some of what some people might think of America. The restaurant was full of cheap oriental decorations, red and white plaid table cloth, serving hamburgers and burritos, and playing 50’s to 80’s classic rock music. By the time we finally made it back to the hostel, not stumbling too hard we met our newest roommate. A older Messianic Jew from Israel. We then decided to head to <a href="http://www.matrix-berlin.de/">The Matrix Club - Berlin</a>. This place is huge, with four different dance floors playing various music. There were sections playing American rap and hip-hop, reggae, techno / house / whatever those styles are, and one playing rock music. It was jammed packed with people (at least a thousand young people), you can see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30718435&amp;l=7db9a&amp;id=44504407">a picture of one of the dance floors</a>. Traveling by the S-Bahn, we were able to make it back to our hostel and to attempt to get some sleep at 5:45 am.</p>

<p>When you fall asleep at 5:45 am, and your alarm goes off at 9:30 after being out all night it is not a very happy sound. We check out of our over-heating room by 10, and were back on the road with our backpacks. Our bags each weigh 50-60 lbs, quite a load to carry all over the city. We debated finding a park and passing out for a couple of hours, but ended up eating ice cream, finding an internet cafe, and making our way to a new hostel. This last night we stayed at the <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Berolina-Backpacker/Berlin/5015">Barcelona Hostel</a>. The room was nice. I read, and explored while Trevor slept. Later that night we went to tour the Berlin Wall. There is an excellent exhibit <a href="http://www.berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de/en/">Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer</a>. It was a very powerful portrayal of the history of the wall.</p>

<p>Today we are looking to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a> via bus. not exactly sure when we will leave Prague or how we are planning on getting back, but I’m sure it will work out. You can also see all the pictures that I uploaded to Facebook from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509202492406.2026131.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=63c2a75df9">Copenhagen and Berlin</a>.

" class="align-right" /> Passport to the world. A photo of my USA Passport that I took while I was sitting in the airport getting ready to leave for Europe.</p>

<p>We checked out of the <a href="http://www.greentortoise.net/">Green Tortoise</a> at about 11:00 am yesterday and left in search of breakfast and coffee. It seems that street vendors often have good cheap food. After sitting in the coffee shop across the street and planning out the route for the rest of the day. We found a Barnes and Nobel and a radio shack and took the bus to the Airport. We arrived about 3 and a half hours before our flight was scheduled to leave. There was nobody at the check in counter. When we went up to the office, they told us that they had no more flights leaving today. The situation worked out, the worker was just incorrect. It was frightening moment.</p>

<p>The plane ride from Seattle to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> was long (about 9.5 hours). I didn’t have a window seat or one of the sought after emergency exit seats. I did have a pretty German girl to talk to, although we aren’t planning on going to where she is from.</p>

<p>Finally we arrived in Denmark. Lots of people spoke English, and it was easy to figure out the train system to get into town (the airport is about 15 minutes outside of town). Food, beer, and looking in all kinds of neat little shops. It’s a pretty good life. Coffee was expensive though (maybe we were getting ripped off for using USD thought. It cost $10 to get two cups of drip coffee.</p>

<p>Our flight finally got into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a> at around 8 pm local time. After not sleeping at all on the plan (meaning I hadn’t slept for almost 48 hours), it was tiring to find a place to stay. The train, bus system seemed intimidating. Less people seem to speak English, it was dark, and our packs where heavy. The first Hostel we went to was booked, but luckily there was a nice one a couple blocks from there. So until tomorrow afternoon we will be staying at the <a href="http://www.meininger-hotels.com/en/hotel-hostel/hotelsearch/berlin/central-station/">Meininger Hostel</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/photo-room-messy-dirty.jpg" alt=" How I left my room prior to going to Europe. " /> How I left my room prior to going to Europe.</p>

<p>Today started our trip. After getting off work this morning, me and Trevor left to catch the bus. Neither of us really felt ready for the trip, and have stuff that we had to get done. I had hoped to have my house cleaned by when it was time to go. This obviously did not happen.We took the Greyhound from Spokane to Seattle… a stupid 7:30 minute ride. We didn’t know where we were going to stay, but found a pretty great hostel, <a href="http://www.greentortoise.net/">Green tortoise Hostel</a>. The room is clean, we have two other roommates (it’s dorm style). They had a great free dinner at which lots of the residents participated. I’ve met people already from Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Korea. They have some sort of activity everyday, today was a water balloon fight. The people seem pretty chill. Me and Trevor decided to wonder around Pike St. market and by the mall. We ended up at a pretty cool bar that had hundreds of taps posted on their walls. A pretty cool atmosphere.having not slept in about 48 hours, I think it is time to crash out and get ready to take off on our transcontinental flight in the morning.</p>

<p>I get off work in an hour and a half. In two hours I leave to take a 7.5 hour bus ride to Seattle. In one day I leave from Seattle and fly to Europe. The first leg of the journey is 9.5 hours, and lands in Copenhagen Denmark. From Copenhagen, it is a one hour flight to Berlin. Once in Europe I will be staying from August 18 till September 23 (five weeks). It’s a pretty exciting trip… but I don’t think it will really hit me until I’m actually there.</p>

<p>Since purchasing this domain name, and transferring all of it to here I have been going to though and giving the entire site a brief overhaul. I’ve had relatively limited experience with PHP. Since migrating my data, I have reduced it dramatically by utilizing the php language for includes for all the material that I add into each page. I have also added added and made a complete section for research and evidence based practice (link no longer valid). In completing this section I even utilized some JavaScript for the specific menu.</p>

<p>More than I have gotten done, I am still on the learning curve for some other projects on the site. For example I am attempting to be able to have an include file for my menu structure. The only problem is that I don’t want it to be static. I have struggled some with trying to implement cookies using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">setcookie()</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$_COOKIE</code> functions in php. I have had difficulty knowing how to debug it.</p>

<p>This would all change based on what specific page the viewer is on. I also loaded the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a> and have attempted to build applications both with that and google earth.</p>

<p>I think all of these overnights that I’m working is catching up with me. A couple of nights ago, I worked an overnight and then had stuff I had to do all morning. I didn’t fall asleep until like five or six pm. I think I was planning on just taking a nap, but slept until morning (like 12 hours). I just woke up from my most recent nap after working an overnight, going to sleep around one in the afternoon. Now it’s nine pm. I’m not exactly sure what I’m supposed to do, because I work in the morning. Do I attempt to go to sleep again in a couple of hours… so I still get a decent amount of sleep because I just got like eight hours. Maybe I’m just trying to get ahead in my sleep so that I’m ready for Europe. Maybe I’m just crazy.</p>
