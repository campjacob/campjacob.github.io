<p>Social workers all wear a number of different hats, or function in a number of different roles for their practice. In this video we talk about 15 different roles that social workers frequently put on. We go through and talk talk about the roles of counselor, case manager, broker, enabler, enabler, educator, facilitator, mediator, negotiator, manager, analyst/evaluator, consultant, integrator/coordinator, spokesperson, organizer/mobilizer, and advocate.</p>

<p>Helping the populations that we work with be able to connect together, feel as if they are in the same boat with persons with similar needs, and giving them opportunities to provide assistance to those persons is a effective way to help people feel supported. Mutual Aid groups are useful for all different types of needs, includes families of youth who have special needs. We discuss what Mutual Aid is and some of the ways that we facilitate groups with Mutual Aid as social workers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Black Madonna or Black Virgin is a statue or painting of Mary in which she, and oftentimes the infant Yahshua are depicted with dark skin, especially those created in Europe in the medieval period or earlier. The Black Madonnas are generally found in Catholic and Orthodox countries. The term refers to a type of Marian statue or painting of mainly medieval origin (12th to 15th centuries), with dark or black features.</p>

<p>The city of lights was beautiful. You can find my photo album on Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100259365182336.1073741840.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=61670512fa">Paris, City of Lights</a>. After spending four nights in Paris, we caught a train heading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, in the Southern France region. In Toulouse, we didn’t really spend much time. We rented cars and spent a little bit of time getting some lunch and wandering around the Toulouse downtown for a bit. We tried to go and see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Madonna">Black Madonna</a>, but we couldn’t find parking. We rented two  cars, mine was a manual. I hadn’t driven a manual transmission car since I was in high school, but after we got into the windy roads of the French Countryside in Midi-Pyrénées, I was glad that was my car. It felt exhilarating to be shifting through all of the roads.</p>

<p>Heading to the Commune of Fabas, we went to the wrong Fabas at first (putting us about 45 minutes in the wrong direction), but we finally made it to some of the most wonderful country I’ve ever seen. We spent four nights in the area. My mom, Geralyn and I stayed at an old family friend of my mother and I, Sheila and Dennis. They used to live in the Dayton Watisburg area where I grew up. They built a house, in the countryside with the most spectacular view. You can check out photos on Facebook album, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100262325235366.1073741841.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=6d066c7b40">French Countryside in the Midi-Pyrénées</a>. We got the opportunity to do a lot of different things while we were there.</p>

<p>Before heading out on our trip, I was the least excited about visiting the countryside. I was thinking that I wouldn’t like it as much, because it is out of the city, but it was amazing! We spent one day touring various small villages, passes, and outlooks.  The views from the some of the passes, and Lake Bethmal were breathtaking. We even picked wild huckleberries on the mountain side. I was amazed at the roads, and sites especially knowing that often times the <a href="http://www.letour.com/us/">Tour de France</a> goes through these mountains. It made me tired just thinking about it. In the City of Seix, I ended up ordering horse (common food in France), it was good and tasted mostly like cow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1858 Lourdes rose to prominence in France and abroad due to the Marian apparitions seen by the peasant girl Bernadette Soubirous, who was later canonized. Shortly thereafter the city became one of the world’s most important sites of pilgrimage and religious tourism. Today Lourdes hosts around six million visitors every year from all corners of the world. This constant stream of pilgrims and tourists transformed quiet Lourdes into the second most important center of tourism in France, second only to Paris, and the third most important site of international Catholic pilgrimage after Rome and the Holy Land. As of 2011, of French cities only Paris had more hotel capacity.</p>

  <p>An estimated 200 million people have visited the shrine since 1860,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse">7</a> and the Roman Catholic Church has officially recognized 69 healings considered miraculous. Cures are examined using Church criteria for authenticity and authentic miracle healing with no physical or psychological basis other than the healing power of the water</p>

<p>Another one of the days, some of us went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes">Lourdes, France</a>. It was a bit of drive, but is an interesting town. There are hundreds of people with diseases, handicaps, and different abilities that make the pilgrimage to Lourdes to seek healing. The church of Lourdes, is gorgeous and I’m pretty sure it is what Disneyland is modeled after.</p>

<p>We also had an amazing five course traditional French meal at the bed and breakfast the rest of my family was staying at. The food was amazing, and we sat, ate, talked, ate, drank, ate, and drank more for almost three and half hours. A wonderful experience.</p>

<p>The next morning, we set off early, heading to Nice. When I told family and friends that I was going to France, everybody was worried because of the attack that happened about a month before our trip in Nice. It was unfortunate that we only got to stay one night in Nice, because it was a hip, vibrant, and fun town. We spent 10 hours driving from Sheila and Dennis to Nice, toll bridges, and craziness, but it was absolutely worth it.</p>

<p>Then it was a train to Florence with a stop in Milan. Our train was late arriving in Milan, and the carrier wouldn’t refund our ticket so we had to wait for another one and purchase it again.</p>

<p>In Florence we’ve had the opportunity see David, walk the streets, go shopping, I’ve gone out a couple of nights and gotten to experience some of the nightlife, and stay in an absolutely beautiful hotel (<a href="http://www.krafthotel.it">Kaft Hotel</a>) with a terrace roof and restaurant and pool. We leave tomorrow to head to the last leg of our trip and Rome.</p>

<p>Family European Adventure 2016 - Paris</p>

<p>It has been a fly by trip so far. My mom, my aunt Geralyn, my cousin Larissa and her boyfriend Shane, and my aunt Barbara and uncle Allen all have made her way over to Europe. Our first stop has been in Paris, the city of lights. It is a beautiful city, with amazing architecture, different little neighborhoods each with their own feel, wonderful architecture, and so many different people.</p>

<p>My mom and I left from the Pasco Airport to Seattle Tacoma Airport where we met up with the rest of our family. Then it was a 10.5 hour flight with a nine hour time difference (yes, we are living in the future). We have been walking a ton. I thought that it might be interesting to share how far we actually have been walking. I have been wearing my Apple Watch (which I absolutely love) the whole trip, so I have a pretty good idea of how far we’ve been walking each day so far.</p>

<p>We arrived in Paris after leaving Friday morning at 8:30 am on Saturday morning. It took a couple of hours to wait to go through customs and we found ourselves a taxi to our hotel, <a href="http://www.hotel-belle-juliette-paris.com/">Hotel &amp; Spa La Belle Juliette</a>. The hotel is somewhat expensive, and much more expensive then any hotels  that I would generally choose, but it is very chic with beautiful small rooms with iMacs in every room that double as a TV. After checking in, we were hungry and headed to <a href="http://www.lenemrod.com">Le Nemrod</a> to get some food and then made our way to a giant beautiful park to wander around a little bit. The <a href="http://www.senat.fr/visite/jardin/index.html">Jardin du Luxembourg</a> is absolutely a wonderful place to go, and really felt very much the epitome of what I imagine when I think of France. There was wonderful statues, old men playing chess and Bocci Ball, and many people just passing time with each other at a slow pace.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/people-playing-chess-at-the-Jardin-du-Luxembourg.jpeg" alt="A photo of people playing chess at the Jardin du Luxembourg." /></p>

<p>After wondering around the park for a couple of hours, playing some Pokémon Go (yes, you have to catch them all) and finding some pizza for dinner we made our way back to the hotel to relax and sleep after a sleepless two days.</p>

<p>Sunday, was a busy day with so many views of the city and little adventures along the way. We made our way to do some shopping and pick up some produce at the Mouffetard Market. Rue de Mouffetard and the market that is nearby is a little get away from modern life with cobble stones and small little stores all around. After doing a little shopping and resting our feet a little bit, we made our way to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthéon">Panthéon in Paris</a>. I will be posting a bunch of pictures from our trip on Facebook (and I’m sure I’ll share a link on here in the future), but the internet that I’ve mostly found has been fairly slow and difficult to upload. Just making this post with a couple of pictures has been a challenge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Panthéon is a building in the Latin Quarter in Paris. It was originally built as a church dedicated to St. Genevieve and to house the reliquary châsse containing her relics but, after many changes, now functions as a secular mausoleum containing the remains of distinguished French citizens. It is an early example of neoclassicism, with a façade modeled on the Pantheon in Rome, surmounted by a dome that owes some of its character to Bramante’s ‘Tempietto.’

<p>I got the opportunity to climb to the top of the Panthéon and take some really great shots of all of Paris. We walked down to the Zig Zag Café where I got the opportunity to try some Escargot for the first time and then we made our way to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris">Cathédrale Notre Dame</a>. Absolutely one of the best cathedrals that I’ve seen in my various trips. By night, we went to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>, and shared a bottle of some tequila as we walked home and so many laughs and fun times with my family.</p>

<p>Monday was a trip to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre">Louvre Museum</a>, some Jazz at <a href="http://www.sunset-sunside.com/">Sunset Subside</a> and sharing some checha at the Isis Café. Today has been mostly a relaxed day, and giving me an opportunity to share a little bit of our adventure with all of you. Here is looking forward to more stores as we go through France and Europe for the next couple of weeks. I will also be posting some photos to Facebook, so look forward to that.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/personal%20blog/professional%20blog/2014/11/14/tracking-trainings-using-dafts-and-launch-center-pro/">Friday November 14, 2014</a> by <a href="/contact">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/track-your-trainings-learn-blocks.jpg" alt="Graphic of Blocks Saying Learn" title="Track Trainings for CEUs and Clock Hours Using Drafts 4 &amp; Launch Center Pro" /></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I spent some times further diving into <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> and <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>. Both are amazing applications for iOS, and have greatly improved my productivity and ability to get things done. I have been absolutely loving my <a href="/blog/2014/8/mileage-tracking-form-and-launch-center-pro">Milage Tracker</a> that I put together, and use it multiple times a day (and find that it makes it so I don’t forget to track). As I have written before, I’m a big fan of using plain <a href="/blog/2014/3/review-of-david-sparkss-markdown-book-an-investigation-to-formatting-documents">text files and Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>Several years ago, when I started working at Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services, and attending various trainings post MSW I started keeping a word document listing all of the various trainings that I attend. If you work in an industry that requires documentation regarding trainings received, hopefully you have started doing that too. I since have change my system around. I now have a plain text file that I keep on dropbox which has a listing of every training that I have received (whether that be in agency or for some sort of professional development certificate). As I have been looking towards applying for my <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/SocialWorker/LicenseRequirements/LicensedIndependentClinicalSocialWorker">LICSW</a> and having my <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/certification/ESAMain.aspx">ESA</a> which requires so many clock hours, I decided that I wanted to also have an easy way to calculate how many CEU’s or Clock Hours without combing through my long text file of all my trainings. I created two <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a> which I could open in Excel or Numbers and have calculate the total number of hours easily. The problem is, I didn’t want to have to write entries sometimes three times. I also wanted to be able to add these entries either from my phone or from my iPad easily when I get to the training. Never having to worry about it again.</p>

<p>With so many iOS automation tasks that I do, it starts in Launch Center Pro (LCP) for me. I have a main entry that collects data in several prompts (you <a href="https://launchcenterpro.com/t4zs0x">can install it</a>). The content is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>launch://x-callback-url/clipboard?text=[prompt:Review=[prompt:Date], [prompt:Training Title], [prompt-num:Number of CEUs or Clock Hours] [list:Type|Clock Hours=Clock Hours|CEUs=CEUs|Both=Clock Hours and CEUs], [list:Type of Units|Ethics= Professional Law and Ethics|Suicide=Suicide Assessment Treatment and Management|General=General Continuing Education Credits|None=|ESA Suicide=ESA Suicide Prevention Intervention Training]]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It creates a final review prompt that includes text regarding the training date, the title of the training, the number of hours, and the type of hours (i.e. Professional Law and Ethics or Suicide Assessment Treatment and Management).</p>

<p>I have this LCP action in my “base” actions folder along with a couple of different actions related to my trainings. All of them send the contents to Drafts for different actions. One action posts the clipboard to an action that appends it to my Clock Hour CSV, one to my CEU CSV, and one to my text file. I then have a main action that calls all of the other actions and let me select if I want to post it to one, two or all three of the actions.</p>

<p>The two actions that I have which append to my Clock Hour CSV and my CEU CSV files are very simple and just append to the files. There are two actions to append to my overall text file. One action takes the comma separated data and uses some JavaScript to split the text at each “, “ and return the text with each section as a new line. You can <a href="http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1NF">install the drafts action</a> or see the JavaScript below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// Function to Parse Comma Separated Value Text
// Jacob Campbell -- http://jacobrcampbell.com/

function parseText(s){
    var temp = new Array();
    temp = s.split(', ');
      var result = "";
      var i;
    for(i=0; i&lt;temp.length; i++) {
        result += temp[i] + "\n";
    }
return result;
}

// Commit content to draft

var text = draft.content;
draft.content = parseText(text);
commit(draft);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The drafts action then passes that data to another action which takes those new lines and adds it to a template page that has the following information:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>## [[line|2]]
* __Date__: [[line|1]]  
* __Location__:   
* __Facilitator__:   
* __CEU / Clock Hours__: [[line|3]], [[line|4]]  
* __Duration__:   
* __Certificate of Completion__:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each of the the parts that say <code class="highlighter-rouge">[[line|n]]</code> takes that line from the draft and puts it there. I then add the last little bit of information (i.e. location, who facilitated it… etc) and I’m all done.</p>

<p>What is amazing, is I can write it once in LCP, have it post to both CSV files and then prepare it for posting it to my text file with only typing minimal text. I have taken it to another level, and have made some OmniFocus task templates that I can post and remember to follow up and see if I have received my confirmation form for my clock hours.</p>

<p>If you have the need to track your clock hours or CEU’s its a pretty awesome system, and I’d highly encourage you steal what I have put together and change it for your own needs.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/mileage-tracking-lauch-center-pro-ifttt-google-sheets.jpg" alt="Mileage Tracking with Launch Center Pro, IFTTT and Google Sheets" title="Mileage Tracking with Launch Center Pro, IFTTT and Google Sheets" /></p>

<p>On <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2014/4/jump-in-the-stream-favorite-podcasts">my favorite podcast</a>, <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a> I feel like I’ve heard about <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a> a number of times. I’ve thought about purchasing it a number of times, because I really like the concept automation. I’ve kept putting off purchasing it because I didn’t know exactly what I would do with it. I use <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> all of the time on my iPhone and my iPad, and it’s always seemed like enough.</p>

<p>I was reading Dr. Drang’s article <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/08/late-to-launch/">Late to Launch</a> earlier today, and decided that I did need to buy Launch Center Pro (LCP). I figured that it was ok, because he is late coming to LCP too.</p>

<p>Basically LCP is an iPhone / iPad app that launches other applications or does tasks within those application. It also gives interaction for IFTTT (which I talked <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2013/1/new-and-fun-functionality">about here</a>), which opens up so many other possibilities.</p>

<p>In reading Dr. Drang’s article, I decided that I needed a simple way to track my mileage. Whenever I go in between schools at my new job, I can submit for a reimbursement for the gas and wear and tear on my car. They don’t require a listing of miles driven, but from one building to another building (the school district dictates what the milage is between buildings, for those people who tend to drive circuitous routes). For last month, I went through my calendar and tried to pick out the days that I drove between different buildings. I’m excited about my new system using LCP and think I will save myself time. One of my co-workers told me that she never has time to fill out her form, so maybe I will have to share this with her.</p>

<p>For all of the non nerds out there, this might sound kind of complicated, but really it is not, and it’s kind of fun to put together. I’ll walk you through what I did. Basically I have an action in LCP that opens two lists which I select from which schools I’m drive from and to, sends those as a row in a Google spreadsheet, and then at the end of the month, IFTTT sends me an email with a link to the spreadsheet to remind me to copy and past it onto the correct from.</p>

<div class="feature__wrapper">

  

</div>

<p>The first step is to create a new action in LCP. I just went through their action composer, found the IFTTT trigger, had it complete a Trigger Recipe with Values. I named my Recipe “Mileage Tracker” (I had to name it the same thing when creating my recipe on IFTTT). Then I set two values as “input with a list.” I made list items of each of the schools that I might go from so that one list is the school building I was leaving and the second would be the school building I would be going to.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/ifttt-screenshot-launch-center-pro.png" alt="My IFTTT recipe" title="My IFTTT recipe." /></p>

<p>My <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/199280-create-mileage-entry-from-launch-center-pro-and-google-drive">IFTTT Recipe</a></p>

<p>Then the IFTTT magic starts. It sends my answers to an IFTT recipe where it appends a spreadsheet in Google docs to add the new data (along with the date) to cells in the the spreadsheet. I made a second IFTT rule sending my work email an notification every month on the last day to complete copy and paste the values from the Google Docs to the appropriate spreadsheet and turn it in to receive my reimbursement.</p>

<p>After I got it all working, I was super excited. It feels amazing to know that I can track my mileage with a couple of clicks on my phone and I won’t ever have to worry about it again. I might have to think about making it based on location… but we will see so that I don’t even have to click anything on my phone.</p>

<p class="caption">A photo of my MacBook Pro taken as I was writing this post at Starbucks off of 390 in Kennewick...</p>

<p>This last week, I had my last day at <a href="http://www.mytcch.org/">Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services</a>, and my have started some of my training for my work at the <a href="http://www.psd1.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1">Pasco School District</a>. I’ve also still been spending quite a bit of time preparing my class lectures for the <a href="http://www.heritage.edu/CampusLocations/TriCities.aspx">Heritage Courses</a> I will be teaching. All that being said, its still a really busy time right now. I figured I’d share some of my geekary from last night that I put together. One of the benefits of being a geek is that can make my computer do magic tricks sometimes, and save myself a lot of hassle and time (although it also means that sometimes I spend a significant amount of time doing things that don’t deserve that much time, but that’s neither here or there).</p>

<p>The reason I am so in love with my mac, is some of the amazing software and things that I can do with it, that just weren’t possible on a Windows PC. I just downloaded <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro - KM</a>, a really powerful and amazing piece of software. I’m very excited to see what I can all automate with it on my mac. I’ve put together a couple of what KM calls macros. The first one I did was in apple mail to make keyboard like shortcuts. I’m not going to write about about it, but I did the same as described <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53254/gmail-like-keyboard-shortcuts-in-mail-app-keys-without-modifiers">Stack Exchange</a>.</p>

<p>I love my Apple TV, and even like the little four button remote that comes with it. I like to use it even when I’m given presentations as my clicker. The only problem is that it always tries to control my mac. We will be sitting on the couch and watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934814/">Chuck</a>, our current show of choice on Netflix, and you click a button and it turns on iTunes or click another button and the volume on my mac goes up and down. It’s a bit of a pain to toggle the IR remote on and off. It’s kind of hidden in the system preferences. If you are turning it on and off, it might look something like this <a href="https://v.usetapes.com/AxaSINsYsY">short screencast</a>. While it doesn’t take way to long, it is kind of an annoying process, and KM can come to the rescue. It wasn’t too hard to set it up and automate the process. I created a keyboard short cut that goes though the whole process with minimal needs for me to do anything when turning on and off the remote.</p>

<p>Basically here is what it does:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/keyboard-maestro-macro-ir-remote.png" alt="A screenshot of my Keyboard Maestro's macro for toggling the IR remote." /></p>

<p>A screenshot of my Keyboard Maestro’s macro for toggling the IR remote.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click ⇧⌘→</li>
  <li>Open “Security &amp; Privacy Preferences Pane”</li>
  <li>Pause for 1.5 seconds (so that it has time to open)</li>
  <li>Click the gatekeeper lock to unlock the advanced settings</li>
  <li>Pause until “Advanced button is available” (waiting for me to put in my password)</li>
  <li>Press “Advanced…” button.</li>
  <li>Wait for user to (I have to click the check box and pair the IR remote).</li>
  <li>Click the “Ok” button</li>
  <li>Re-lock the gatekeeper.</li>
  <li>Quite the system’s preferences pane.</li>
</ol>

<p>It makes me feel a little bit like my mac does magic for me, so beautiful. You can see the <a href="https://v.usetapes.com/KVk70MAAFE">short screencast</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I can just click a couple of keys, and turn on and off my Apple TV Remote when I’m teaching… easy as that.</p>

<p>I used a photo of from <a href="/events/2013/12/mateos-baby-dedication-at-a-very-merry-eastlake-christmas-party">Mateo’s baby dedication</a> to complete a <a href="http://www.anaface.com">Ana Faces Facial Beauty Analysis</a>.  He got a 7.37 although I think he’s much cuter than that.</p>

<p><a href="http://freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a> recently had an episode of their podcast, <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2014/01/30/reasons-to-not-be-ugly-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">Reasons to Not Be Ugly</a>. The episode looks at beauty, and how it effects peoples lives from being a cute baby to working and marriage relationships in adulthood. It was pretty interesting.</p>

<p>It made me think about how fussy people are for Mateo. When I take him to the store and other public locations, people are always fussing over him and saying how cute he is. This helps me to justify my feelings and bias that Mateo is by far one of the cutest babies out there.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/jacob-campbell-facial-symmetry-score.png" alt="A photo I took when I was living in  Cusco Peru , It's probably not the best photo I could choose to check my facial symmetry, but it made me laugh.  My score from  Ana Faces Facial Beauty Analysis  was a 3.13." /></p>

<p>A photo I took when I was living in <a href="/blog?tag=Cusco%20Peru">Cusco Peru</a>, It’s probably not the best photo I could choose to check my facial symmetry, but it made me laugh.  My score from <a href="http://www.anaface.com">Ana Faces Facial Beauty Analysis</a> was a 3.13.</p>

<p>If you had previously asked me how to tell the attractiveness of an individual, I would not have guessed that facial symmetry would be a good way to identify attractiveness. I decided that I needed to have a more objective way of measuring both my and Mateo’s attractiveness. For Mateo, he scored a 7.37 (although I would say he should be higher and I just didn’t put the points accurately). It is still a good score, especially for somebody who still has a lot of growth to happen. I used, <a href="http://www.anaface.com">Ana face</a>’s Facial Beauty Analysis. I ended up uploading one of my pictures, but it did not turn out that I was nearly as cute as Mateo. I will say, that the photo I uploaded was a bit more joking and probably one that doesn’t quite do me justice. I’m ok with my score of 3.13. I can rest assured that at least Mateo will not be discriminated against based on his looks.</p>

<p>With the worldwide, national, state, and local economies facing an economic downturn, it is important to examine its effects on social service agencies and social work. The active policy of how economic downturns effect social service agencies is examined though a number of modalities. When looking at these types of policies the affected populations must be described. The historical, worldwide, national, and statewide perspectives provide context and understanding of the problem. A policy analysis matrix is also utilized to give a more concrete description of the crisis.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/cartoon-lost-found-funny-stock.jpg" alt="Good Deed A Day - It features a Lost and Found Booth with boxes of various human feelings." class="align-left" /> This Cartoon was taken from the blog Good Deed A Day . It features a Lost and Found Booth with boxes of various human feelings. While on my trip I didn’t loose my feelings, I felt it was a good picture to use.</p>

<p>During my trip I lost, broke, or other crazy events happened. The following is a list of all the things big and small.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I didn’t get stickers for my water bottle (the one souvenir that i got from every where I went) in <a href="/locations/copenhagen-denmark">Denmark</a> and the <a href="/locations/prague-czech-republic">Czech Republic</a>.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/berin-germany">Berlin</a>, before we even left for our second city… I forgot my favorite hoodie at the bus station. I must say that while in the US I’ve had people offer to buy this hoodie off of me while at coffee shops… maybe I should have taken them up on the offer.</li>
  <li>I lost my time. I bought post cards to sent to friends and family in <a href="/locations/prague-czech-republic">Prague</a>… but never sent them off. I actually thew them away when I got to the US, even though I filled them out.</li>
  <li>In preparation of flying, I sold my tent for €10.00 (about $13.48800)… probably worth at least $100.</li>
  <li><a href="/locations/vienna-austria">Vienna</a> was the first country that we decided to fly from… well actually <a href="/locations/bratislava-slovakia">Bratislava</a>. I threw away a number of other camping gear, rain gear, and several sets of cloths (leaving me with 2 shorts, 1 pants and a bunch of shirts and other stuff) at the airport.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/barcelona-spain">Barcelona</a>, we lost an airplane ticket… we though we were staying an extra day.</li>
  <li>I also tore one of my shorts, leaving me with 1 pair of shorts and 1 pair of pants.</li>
  <li>Due to my computer breaking (see later item in list) I lost many of my pictures of <a href="/locations/rome-italy">Rome</a> and <a href="/locations/bergemo-italy">Bergemo</a>.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/riga-latvia">Lativa</a>, I broke my computer (or maybe the hostel I was staying at… not exactly sure). Luckily I was able to purchase an accidental protection plan when I got home. This still cost me close to $400, and made be very broke!</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/riga-latvia">Riga</a>, I told a friend that I would get him a souvenir. The shops closed before I made it there, and I didn’t get him the one I wanted to (cool leather covered liquor bottle).</li>
  <li>Somebody stole my €10.00 plastic watch that I bought because I was tired of never knowing what time it was and being late for check out time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/krakow-poland">Krakow</a> I tore my only pair of pants beyond repair… leaving me with one pair of pants. Also, my flip flops broke forcing me to walk in the rain with my right foot continually falling out of the thong.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>I also did cosmetic damage to the second watch that I purchased in <a href="/locations/warsaw-poland">Warsaw</a>… due to losing the first one.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/budapest-hungary">Budapest</a>, we missed another plane, and I think I got bit by bed bugs.</li>
  <li>In <a href="/locations/london-united-kingdom">London</a>, I lost a cool zippo lighter that I bought in the <a href="/locations/prague-czech-republic">Czech Republic</a>.</li>
  <li>I bought a map that my “Lets Go Western Europe” suggested and realized it was worthless, so I traded it for a much cheaper better one.</li>
  <li>The button on my last pair of shorts broke, almost leaving me pants less while going though airport security.</li>
  <li>I lost Trevor in Europe, he decided not to come back with me and is currently in Spain.</li>
  <li>After getting home to <a href="/locations/seattle-washington">Seattle</a>, I lost my cell phone in a taxi.</li>
  <li>I got home, and my computer was broken, I lost my cell phone so I felt very disconnected from life… and realized that somebody stole my bike.</li>
  <li>Finally I lost my financial security. I’ve gone back to donating plasma (first time today in a long time), haven’t bought groceries and am hoping to get paid before my rent is due… other wise I’ll have to figure out something quick</li>
</ul>

<p>Although that is quite a list of lost items, I wouldn’t trade my trip experience for any of it or all of it. It was a truly amazing trip. I really could have made a longer list of all the things I got from the trip, but thought that this was a bit funnier. When / if you have traveled, have you lost, broke or done something else to your stuff.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2008/9/the-way-home">Tuesday September 23, 2008</a> by <a href="/contact">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>Currently I am sitting in the Airport at Heathrow in London… and absolutely huge airport. But to catch you up on events, I have about 18 minutes until it’s time to go and catch a plane home. So this post might be trying to fit a lot in, with a very short time.</p>

<h2 id="krakow-auschwitz-and-more-rain">Krakow, Auschwitz, and More Rain</h2>

<p>I loved Krakow, except for all of the rain. All of my clothes where dirty (also, sorry about any spelling mistakes in this post… the computer I’m using has some stupid browser, so I can’t do much) so I wondered around in shorts and flip flops in the cold rainy days in Poland. I finally broke down and bought a new pair of pants too from the local mall. The last day that we were in Krakow we made a expedition to Auschwitz.</p>

<p>I went to the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. years ago with the Master’s Commission. It was probably one of the most impactful places that I’ve ever been. It was really quite a different experience to actually walk on the ground where so many people were murdered. We also went to Birkkenau, where all of the crematoriums were. The whole place just had an airy sad feeling to it.</p>

<h2 id="budapest-and-spas-at-2am">Budapest and Spa’s at 2am</h2>

<p>Budapest is one of the few cities that I’ve been to that I really could see myself living in. I would highly recommend if you are making a Europe trip to go to Budapest (and lots of Eastern Europe). There are lots of great sites to go and see. We saw a church built into a rock cave (cave church), climbed a hill with a spectacular view of the city and cool little shops. There are many different Thermal springs in Budapest, and we went to one and stayed there late into the night. Really it was such a great place, that we ended up staying longer than we planned and buying a second plane ticket.</p>

<p>When traveling it is a great idea to be very through when making travel arrangements. For example if you buy a ticket going to the airport, you should know if it is the only stop or not. We ended up going to a town in the country of Hungary instead of the airport. We met the nicest young couple home for the weekend from University. They took us to their parents house, made food for us, drove us to the train station and even waited for the train to leave us. They were an amazingly hospitable family and was a great experience.</p>

<h2 id="london-only-for-three-days">London only for Three Days</h2>

<p>London is a huge, world class city. It took almost 2 hours to get from one side to the other through the underground. The sites were beautiful. I will upload pictures when I get home. We took a free walking tour which was interesting and the Australian leading it was hilarious. It was a great stay, but way to short. London really needs at least a week to do it any justice, but I was glad for the three nights.</p>

<p>I stand here now, needing to leave for my plane (I don’t want to miss this one, it wouldn’t be a good idea). I am sad to know that I’m going to be stopping traveling, but happy to come home and see friends and family. I hope to see all of you soon.</p>

<p>Still a bit sick, but I slept in very late and probably wondering around in on a cold rainy day isn’t the best idea. I really didn’t want to stay sick all day, so I figured I would just tough though it. After sleeping in late, I made my way to Wawel Castle and the Cathedral that is their. It is very beautiful, and houses the kripts for many influential people from Poland. Listening to my audio guide I was struck by how many of them had so many scenes depicting their lives. On their caskets, it showed the major events that transpired in their lives. It got me to thinking about what at the end of my life might go on my casket or what I would want to be remembered by. Above is a song by Tupac, “How long will they mourn me.” It also made me think about this. Anyways, just a thought. Also, be advised that the song has a lot of explicit lyrics.</p>

<p>Tonight I sat around the hostel most of the night. I think I’m coming down with a cold, which is a stupid thing to have happen when your traveling. After eating a Kabob (the most excellent type of vendor food out there), a couple of us sat down a watched a movie. I’ve been dowsing myself with green tea, hoping to fend off this cold quickly. While checking stuff online, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en-US/more/index.html (Google’s new Google Chrome Browser)">Google’s new Google Chrome Browser</a>. I have been a strong supporter of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ (FireFox)">FireFox</a> as a default browser. But a new browser coming from Google might change my stance. I spent the last 15 or 20 minutes reading the <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/small_00.html (Comic Book description of the browser)">Comic Book description of the browser</a>. It was very interesting and something I’d recommend to anybody that has a bit of a technology-geek inside of them. I was fairly convinced about the new browser. It will be a while for me to test it out and see what I really think once I get home, but I might have to change.</p>

<h2 id="all-roads-lead-to-rome">All Roads Lead to Rome</h2>

<p>I guess it’s time to play a little catch up for everybody. It’s been a while since I’ve posted and since I’ve lost my computer I’ve been very much more at the whim of public computers with weird keyboards, high costs (not too bad… but not as cheap as free), and slow old hardware.</p>

<p>Trevor and I spent four nights in Rome. We arrived into Rome city center fairly late (maybe 2300 hours). We had a couple of ideas of hostels, but they all seemed to be booked. We ran around the city center for about 2 hours with our packs but were unsuccessful in finding a cheap hostel. We finally settled to stay at this over priced place (about 30 Euros a night) for the first night. The next morning we made our way to Camping Plus about 50 km outside of town. It was pretty perfect, and probably had the best showers that we’ve had the entire trip. I made my way back into town and wondered around the Vatican. I spent most of my time in a the St. Pietro. It was an amazing church. You can see about half of my photos from Rome and the Vatican, but the rest will have to wait till I get back to the states and figure out what to do with my computer. I also found my way to the Pantheon, an amazing building. I came back before it got to late and hung out with some travelers from the UK in the bar at the campsite.</p>

<p>Trevor and I ended up not seeing the sites together in Rome. Maybe it was time to have a break from hanging out 24 7. The next morning, sleeping in was a glorious experience. I made my way to the Colosseum. It is truly a massive building. Laying out in the grass in front I got to hear a part of a English speaking tour for free. In front of the Colosseum, there were all of these guy’s dressed like Romans for you to take your picture with. I should have expected that they were going to try to rip me off, when he asks if my watch was a rollex (I spent 10 Euro’s to buy a watch because I was so tired of never having a clue what time it was). I asked him how much to take a picture, and he said a tip. Got a couple of amazing pictures. Then he held onto my camera and said that it was going to be 10 Euros (about 16 USD). I told him to just delete the pictures.</p>

<p>I made my way back to the campsite to go swimming for a bit. Then I met up with some travelers that I had met the night before. A girl from Sweden and one from Ukraine. We had planned to go out into Rome that evening. After getting some food and making a quick stop back at their tent before taking off, they found out that somebody had stolen a bunch of their stuff. Some of it was very expensive too. We spent much of the evening trying to talk to the police (so they could get money back from their insurance). Then we played Mao until early in the morning. Good times. Me and Trevor met up with them again and wondered around the city later the next day. Our plane left the next morning at like 5am… stupid early. We decided not to sleep and just go to the airport with our bags. We ended up not figuring out how to get to the train stop that we were attempting to, but found a group of Italian youth who were actually heading to the same airport.</p>

<p>You must really attempt to imagine this. We are o a bus, and realize that we just missed our stop. I hear some people talking to the bus driver about the Camino airport (another Ryan Air stop). We are trying to communicate with them, although they don’t speak English. After following them, we find out that they are planning to walk to the airport. We see them stop and ask for directions several times and go the wrong direction at least once. The entire trek took about an hour and a half, while carrying our bags. By the end we were drenched in sweat, but proud of ourselves.</p>

<h2 id="cities-instead-of-capitals-the-town-of-bergemo">Cities Instead of Capitals, the Town of Bergemo</h2>

<p>Much of our trip so far, we have only really hit up capitals and major cities within a country. Bergemo was a nice break from that. Although less people spoke English, people were more willing to help. We met a waiter who was very excited to meet us when he heard us speak English. As soon as he heard we were from the USA, he asked Obama or McCain. We spent two nights at <a href="http://www.ostellodibergamo.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=215&amp;lang=en (Bergamo Youth Hostel)">Bergamo Youth Hostel</a>. It was pretty fantastic, except that it cost 8 Euros to do laundry.</p>

<h2 id="do-you-really-have-to-know-where-something-is-to-fly-there-riga">Do You Really Have to Know Where Something is to Fly There, Riga</h2>

<p>We weren’t sure were we were going next so we decided to see where was fairly cheap to fly to, and stay (i.e. Eastern Europe). We found a city, Riga in Latvia. Neither of us had ever heard of Latvia or Riga, but it sounded like a great plan. We just went, not knowing anything and it was a great city. We stayed at <a href="http://www.franksbackpackers.hostel.com/ (Friendly Fun Franks Hostel)">Friendly Fun Franks Hostel</a>. What a name hu? It was a really great place, although a bit rowdy. Any place that you walk in the door and they tell you take your backpack off and ask you if you want a free beer before even checking you in is pretty amazing. We wondered around Riga for two days. We got to see the view from the tallest church that overlooks the city and the river. We met some pretty cool Irish travelers. We explored a lot of the old USSR buildings. It was a great time.</p>

<h2 id="it-gets-colder-poland">It gets colder, Poland</h2>

<p>Currently I’m in Poland. Krakow to be precise. We took a 12 hour overnight bus from Riga to Warsaw, and spent the night before last in Warsaw. Then Yesterday we came to Krakow. Krakow is a pretty cool old town. Much of it dates back to the 13th Century and it was left un-touched during the War. More to come soon.</p>

<p>So you can expect to not have me uploading more pictures for a while. Currently my computer is broken. I don’t know if it is from stuffing my computer bag into my backpacking bag (which I have done the entire trip) or from keeping it in the hostel safe in Riga. I tried to expect something to happen to my computer during my trip, but it still sucks when it does. Some how the computer screen got cracked and now I can’t see out of it (using one of the hostels computers). I think that it might be that back in the states I am way too attached to my computer, but whatever, it will work out. Anyways, to everybody out there who has had their computers broken or to people who got expensive things stolen from them (i.e. Nadja).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/photo-brataslava-dev%C3%ADn-castle-2.jpg" alt=" View from Devín Castle " /> View from Devín Castle</p>

<p>You can see pictures of Bratislava and Castle Devin on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509536742566.2026594.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=8ebf4963ce">Facebook album <em>Ahoj, Bratislava here we come</em></a>. We have taken a couple of flights though a cheap airlines in Europe, Ryan Air. They never fly to the major city that you are trying to get to. For example they advertise flying to Vienna but they really fly out of Slovakia (about a 50 minute train ride). I’m really glad to have gotten to go though. It can be very worth it if you can find flights for like 10-30 Euro’s, just watch out for all of the added fees… and luggage restrictions.</p>

<p>We got into Bratislava and were both ready for a relaxation day. We wondered around town for a little bit, found our way to a grocery store. We bought some random meat and cheese that we weren’t exactly sure what it was. I bought some fish kabobs and some potatoes. We returned to <a href="http://www.patiohostel.com/index2.php?lang=eng&amp;action=home">Patio Hostel</a> where we would be staying the night. Trevor cooked what he called a travelers meal. We chilled out and watched a movie and just relaxed for the night.</p>

<p>While doing some laundry in the middle of the night (that’s when everybody does laundry, right?) I had my first cup of cool water experience. It has been a little while since I spent some time worshiping, and it seems as if we have had many Sunday’s as our travel days. Sitting in the laundry room I got to spend like an hour just worshiping, reading my bible and praying. I was very dry and thirsty for some of God’s Presence.</p>

<p>The next morning we made a trip to Castle Devin. It was a spectacular castle, and the first very old one that we have gone and toured. It was first started to be built a bit before 900 A.D.</p>

<p>Over looking the river the view was spectacular. I was hoping to find a dungeon, but everything below the castle was locked up.</p>

<p>After wondering around ancient castle it was time to catch a bus and then an over priced taxi to the airport. It was then that I found my second cup of cool water. We met a fellow traveler Jaume. He was in Bratislava and traveling back home to Barcelona. We shared some coffee and some conversation. It was not until we later that we would recognize him as one of the coolest and most hospitable travelers we had met so far</p>

<h2 id="barcelona-beaches-the-city-by-night-missed-connections-and-prostitutes">Barcelona, Beaches, The City By Night, Missed Connections, and Prostitutes</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/media/photo-barcelona-beach.jpg" alt=" Beach at Barcelona " /> Beach at Barcelona</p>

<p>Jaume offered to drive us to the city. We stopped and had a sandwich on the way for some dinner. He called our hostel for us and made sure that they had rooms, giving us our first reservations on the trip. After taking us to the door and making sure everything was alright at the hostel for us he went home to get only a few hours of sleep He also offered to meet us the next night and show us around Barcelona.</p>

<p>The next morning we headed out to the beach. You can see all of my pictures from Barcelona on Facebook Album <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509536937176.2026595.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=f73146678f"><em>Barcelona, burning at the beach</em></a>. It felt so amazing to just be able to lay on a beach and go and jump in at will. I must say that my shorts collection has thinned out considerably due to RyanAir. They only allow 15 kilos (about 33 lbs) on any of their flights, so my first flight I let go of a lot of different items. One of these items was my swimsuit I packed. My cargo shorts worked just fine.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/photo-barcelona-night.jpg" alt=" Barcelona by Night " /> Barcelona by Night</p>

<p>After a day wondering around the beautiful beaches, we found our way back to La Ramblas a very touristy area. We just relaxed for a while until it was time to be picked up by Jaume. He came and took us to some places that it would have been impossible to find ourselves. First we went some streets and showed us some of the Gaudi architecture, which is very impressive. The next stop was at Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar. A very impressive work in progress. It is being built completely from public donations. A very amazing feat, not to mention the math that was required to be done when it was designed. He then took us up to the top of a two mountains and showed us city by night. It was phenomenal. We then went to get some drinks and Jaume left us on our own. We found our way to the beach and took a midnight swim with some travelers from France, Australia, and the UK. Coming back at 3 am we ran into some of Barcelona’s prostitutes. They whistle and kiss at you. Then they grab your arm and don’t want to let go. It was quite disconcerting.</p>

<p>After waking up in the morning at <a href="http://www.hfernando.com/">Hostel Fernando</a> and going to check email we realized that we had a problem. We were supposed to fly out that morning. the whole time we thought we had three days, not two nights. It can be so confusing traveling. Anyways, my paid time for the internet is coming up and I will tell you about Rome later.</p>

<p>In traveling, it seems that there are seasons of just going and doing. There are also some times that are refreshing like a cup of cool water. It has been a few days since I have written last (about four) and I’ve been in three different countries (Austria, Slovakia, and Spain). Within this whorl wind of visits, I have also found some amazing cups of cool water but I will have to get to those in a minute.</p>

<p>We arrived super early to Vienna Austria (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Wien Österreich</a>), about 0500. We planned to stay at <a href="http://www.wombats-hostels.com/vienna/">the Wombats Youth Hostel</a>, a place in our travels that has come highly recommended. They let us reserve some beds in their dorm, but we were not allowed to actually check in until 1400. Tired, we took showers in their guest showers and ventured into the early morning streets of Vienna. After stopping for breakfast (if you can call a few slices of cheese, meat, garnish, and coffee that) we were both exhausted. We walked about a couple of parks hoping for a bench or nice slab of grass to pass out in. We made our way back to the hostel… but it was still way too early to check in. We both ended up passing out on the sidewalk in the front of the building. After checking in, we took a short nap. I wondered around the city for while and hung out and meet some travelers in the hostel bar. When Trevor finally woke up me, him, Lisa and Chris (a couple from Australia) decided to sneak into the other Wombat bar. It just sounded like fun. We shared Jägerbombs with a couple from Belgem and talked with some film makers from Texas.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/vienna-naschmarkt.jpg" alt=" The Naschmarkt is Vienna's most popular market. Located at the Wienzeile over the  Wien River . " /> The Naschmarkt is Vienna’s most popular market. Located at the Wienzeile over the Wien River.</p>

<p>As always, the next morning came too early and it was time to check into a new hostel (Wombats was full the next night). We found a room at <a href="http://www.hostelruthensteiner.com/">Hostel Ruthensteiner</a>, really a close walk. We again wondered around Vienna. We walked along a main shopping district and watched all of the various street performers. After walking in circles for a bit trying to find our way, we found the Naschmarkt. This seems to be a mixture of open air stores and a flea market. Following all of the winding trails under umbrellas and throngs of people, only to find some very interesting pictures. You can find all of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509459622116.2026486.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=486744b8a9">the photos from Vienna on facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Riding the underground to the <a href="http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/">Schönbrunn Palace</a> it was breath taking to see. The garden behind had millions of little areas to go and explore. That night we went out for a couple of hours. The next morning we were on our way to Slovakia. You’ll have to hear about the cool water experiences a bit later. It’s almost 2130 and I’m supposed to meet up with Trevor in a couple of minutes. Currently I’m in Barcelona… so I’ve got quite a bit to catch you up on.</p>

<p>I am really glad to have been able to go to another German town other than Berlin. Berlin was a blast, a very young hip town. Munich (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich">Münichen in German</a>), seems to be more conservative and upper class than Berlin. Although you won’t see throngs of people walking around the streets with their beer in hand, you will see some great beer halls and gardens. Munich is probably most famous for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest">Octoberfest</a>, a holiday that I am sad we will be missing. We did go and see a number of sites around Munich that are notable. After arriving in Munich at about 05:30 am, we figured out their public transportation system and how to get to our next Hostel. We arrived very early in the morning to a place called <a href="http://www.the-tent.com/">The Tent</a>. It is a very neat idea for a place to stay. Generally you can stay there for €10.50 or €5.50 if you want to utilize your own tent. They have these giant circus type tents, I think that two of them accommodate 150 people. A lot of the travelers tend to just hang out at the camp around the fire. We slept till later in the afternoon after checking in and decided to take the 15 minute tram ride to the center of town.</p>

<p>We wondered for a couple of hours around the center of town just taking in the sites. We saw a fairly neat church Saint Paul. We returned to the tent fairly early and just hung out with a everybody around the camp site.</p>

<p>The next morning, after sleeping in some and lounging around the campsite reading, we decided to really start our touring around Munich. The first stop was <a href="http://g.co/maps/w8azh">Englischer Garten Places Page</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englischer_Garten">Wikipedia article about Englischer Garten</a>)one of the worlds largest city parks… and much larger than New York’s Central Park. We found some locals who were heading to the park themselves and we made it there perfectly well from the subway system. Right at the entrance is a man made permanent wave, where people come and surf. It is a very neat site, fun to watch all of the surfer wipe out. Wondering down the path there are tons of people sitting out in the sun or the shade all over the park. It is also not uncommon for the locals to sunbathe nude in the park… it’s all just kind of mixed in. Although we didn’t lose our cloths around the park, we did loose some of our money at the parks great beer garden for lunch. There you can order an expensive L. of beer, some some traditional bavarian food (like a pork knuckle), and listen to the traditional music played by musicians in lederhosen. It is a fun experience. After wondering around the park for several hours (and still not seeing all of it), we decided that it was time to continue on.

We wondered around downtown for a while, finally deciding that we wanted to head to one of the most famous beer halls in Munich, <a href="http://www.hofbraeuhaus.de/en/index_en.html">Hofbräuhaus</a>. I would have to say that it is a must see for anybody traveling in Munich.</p>

<p>After stopping at the grocery story, we headed back to the tent with a few surprises for our fellow guests. First we picked up some marshmallows (no chocolate and gram crackers… we’re having to live poor). Their marshmallows are smaller and don’t cook as well as ones in the USA, but everybody enjoyed them. The later it got, we started realizing how hungry we really where. We had bought some frozen chickens, and had started boiling them. They were taking a long time. Trevor was cooking, and when I went to go and check in on him I find him stabbing the chicken with some large pointed sticks. He hands the chicken to me and explains that I am supposed to go outside and cook it via the open fire. When this all starts, everybody body starts yelling and getting really excited. They even made a wave around the fire. We were the talk of the camp site. After about an a half hour of attempting to burn our chicken (maybe I should call it… cook it Cajun Style), we decided to take the blackened chicken back to the kitchen and cook it there. All in all it was a fun night</p>

<p>The following morning we checked out of the hostel and hung out till it was time for our bus to leave, heading to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Vienna Austria</a>. On the overnight bus, I had the opportunity to sit next to a German girl studying social work in Vienna. We ended up talking the whole night and was a really great connection. Too bad she had plans to be camping with her boyfriend over the weekend, so she wouldn’t be able to show us around. It was a really interesting connection though.</p>

<p>Our stay in Prague has been a blur of beautiful tours of the various sites, long walks back and forth to our hostel, late night to early morning going out, cathedrals and castles. All in all a great trip.</p>

<p>Our first day we went to the [<a href="http://www.nm.cz/index.php?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2">Národní Muzeum</a> <a href="http://www.nm.cz/index.php?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2">National Museum</a>. We did not buy a camera pass so, there are no pictures from the inside. It was full of a zoological history of the world. So many ancient and modern species were represented. there was also history about the Czech Republic and their decent from communism and Russia. It was a very informative museum, although much of it was only in Czech. We spent much of the remainder of the day wondering around the winding streets of old Prague. I find the area to be very confusing. The buildings tower over the cobblestone streets. The old rock streets wind in and out of each other (changing names every few blocks) and never following a set grid. We found our way to [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Astronomical_Clock">the Astronomical Clock</a> in the town center. From the top you can see over the entire city (the top picture is taken from here, and shows the Prague Castle). After wondering around the town all day, we made it back to the Hostel about 20:00.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/photo-prague-cz-charles-bridge-crowd.jpg" alt="Crowd on Charles Bridges in Prague" /> Crowd on Charles Bridges in Prague</p>

<p>At the hostel there was a group of travelers getting ready to go out on a Pub Crawl. Neither me or Trevor had heard or been on a Pub Crawl before. The idea is that Travelers from all over (various hostels) all meet together at a specified location. Then they pay a local to get “free drinks” for the first hour and then to be taken to the cities best clubs. We found this to be a great way to meet people. About 10 people from our hostel went and we met up with about 50 other people. It was a pretty fun evening. Me and Marcelo (a guy from Brazil) didn’t get back until about 5:30 am.</p>

<p>After living up the night life in Prague, I woke up to go and see some more of the sites. Me and Trevor traveled to the other side of the river heading towards the Prague Castle. Along the way, there were a number of neat shops and amazing views. We crossed over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge">Charles Bridge</a> which was jam packed full of people, street vendors, artists, and musicians. On the other side of the Charles Bridge we found the greatest statue that we found (and we saw a lot). I guess it might be a little mature, so don’t play it if you are easily offended;</p>

The Czech Crown Jewels are kept here</p>

<p>We wondered up to the Prague Castle, which really was more of a old Cathedral. Positioned at the top of the hill just behind Prague, it gave a breath taking view of the old city. Standing in line waiting go to hear some of the history of this building and about the Gargoyles that rest around the edge. After wondering around the Castle it was back to the Hostel to meet up with some people. We went out with some girls from Ireland… and had a pretty relaxed evening. The morning came too early and with that time to check out. Our bus leaves for Munich Germany at 23:55 and arrives at 05:30. hopefully we will be able to sleep on the bus. As for the rest of the day, I see us just spending time relaxing.</p>

<p>Facebook is currently not letting me upload the pictures… I will post links after it starts to work.</p>

<p>As promised, we did go to <a href="http://g.co/maps/nj846 (Link to Google maps)">Prague</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague (Wikipedia article on Prague)">in Czech “Praha”</a>). It took 6 and a half hours to travel there by bus. We spent the morning wondering around the bus depot. Upon arriving in Prague, we figured out where we were fairly quickly. But we ended up wondering around in the rain until about 1:30 in the morning. We also talked to three different hostels. Our 16 person dorm room in the <a href="http://www.hostelmarabou.com/en/node/9 (Hostel Marabou)">Hostel Marabou</a> is pretty nice.</p>

<p>The last two days seem to blur together some. I am coming to understand that my days here in Europe will be very full and have all sorts of different activities. The day before yesterday, we again stayed at the <a href="http://www.meininger-hotels.com/en/hotel-hostel/hotelsearch/berlin/central-station/">Meininger Hostel</a>, and hung out some with our dorm mate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30718436&amp;l=8a276&amp;id=44504407">Carlos</a>. We spent a considerable amount of time walking all over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a>. I have since become fairly familiar and able to navigate my way around. This is especially true in regards to the subway / train system. It’s pretty easy to follow once you get the hang of it. We visited Märkisches Museum‎ (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode&amp;view=map&amp;q=M%C3%A4rkisches+Museum%E2%80%8E+Berlin+Germany&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.519668%2C13.413448&amp;spn=0.022875%2C0.064373&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A">Märkisches Museum‎ Google Places Page</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">||</code> <a href="http://www.berlinstadtservice.de/xinh/Maerkische_Museum_Berlin.html">Märkisches Museum‎ Website</a>). They had wonderful exhibits depicting ancient history in Germany and Berlin. No photographs permitted though, or else I would prove that they used to have moose in Germany. They also had an exhibit showing the history of lights in Berlin.</p>

<p>After eating some dinner we started to make our way back to the Hostel. We decided to attempt to stop at all the various bars and restaurants for a drink till we made it back to the Hostel. One interesting bar / club that we stopped at was <a href="http://www.whitetrashfastfood.com/">White Trash Fast Food</a>. It was interesting seeing maybe some of what some people might think of America. The restaurant was full of cheap oriental decorations, red and white plaid table cloth, serving hamburgers and burritos, and playing 50’s to 80’s classic rock music. By the time we finally made it back to the hostel, not stumbling too hard we met our newest roommate. A older Messianic Jew from Israel. We then decided to head to <a href="http://www.matrix-berlin.de/">The Matrix Club - Berlin</a>. This place is huge, with four different dance floors playing various music. There were sections playing American rap and hip-hop, reggae, techno / house / whatever those styles are, and one playing rock music. It was jammed packed with people (at least a thousand young people), you can see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30718435&amp;l=7db9a&amp;id=44504407">a picture of one of the dance floors</a>. Traveling by the S-Bahn, we were able to make it back to our hostel and to attempt to get some sleep at 5:45 am.</p>

<p>When you fall asleep at 5:45 am, and your alarm goes off at 9:30 after being out all night it is not a very happy sound. We check out of our over-heating room by 10, and were back on the road with our backpacks. Our bags each weigh 50-60 lbs, quite a load to carry all over the city. We debated finding a park and passing out for a couple of hours, but ended up eating ice cream, finding an internet cafe, and making our way to a new hostel. This last night we stayed at the <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Berolina-Backpacker/Berlin/5015">Barcelona Hostel</a>. The room was nice. I read, and explored while Trevor slept. Later that night we went to tour the Berlin Wall. There is an excellent exhibit <a href="http://www.berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de/en/">Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer</a>. It was a very powerful portrayal of the history of the wall.</p>

<p>Today we are looking to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a> via bus. not exactly sure when we will leave Prague or how we are planning on getting back, but I’m sure it will work out. You can also see all the pictures that I uploaded to Facebook from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509202492406.2026131.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=63c2a75df9">Copenhagen and Berlin</a>.

<p>We checked out of the <a href="http://www.greentortoise.net/">Green Tortoise</a> at about 11:00 am yesterday and left in search of breakfast and coffee. It seems that street vendors often have good cheap food. After sitting in the coffee shop across the street and planning out the route for the rest of the day. We found a Barnes and Nobel and a radio shack and took the bus to the Airport. We arrived about 3 and a half hours before our flight was scheduled to leave. There was nobody at the check in counter. When we went up to the office, they told us that they had no more flights leaving today. The situation worked out, the worker was just incorrect. It was frightening moment.</p>

<p>The plane ride from Seattle to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> was long (about 9.5 hours). I didn’t have a window seat or one of the sought after emergency exit seats. I did have a pretty German girl to talk to, although we aren’t planning on going to where she is from.</p>

<p>Finally we arrived in Denmark. Lots of people spoke English, and it was easy to figure out the train system to get into town (the airport is about 15 minutes outside of town). Food, beer, and looking in all kinds of neat little shops. It’s a pretty good life. Coffee was expensive though (maybe we were getting ripped off for using USD thought. It cost $10 to get two cups of drip coffee.</p>

<p>Our flight finally got into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a> at around 8 pm local time. After not sleeping at all on the plan (meaning I hadn’t slept for almost 48 hours), it was tiring to find a place to stay. The train, bus system seemed intimidating. Less people seem to speak English, it was dark, and our packs where heavy. The first Hostel we went to was booked, but luckily there was a nice one a couple blocks from there. So until tomorrow afternoon we will be staying at the <a href="http://www.meininger-hotels.com/en/hotel-hostel/hotelsearch/berlin/central-station/">Meininger Hostel</a>.</p>

<p>Today started our trip. After getting off work this morning, me and Trevor left to catch the bus. Neither of us really felt ready for the trip, and have stuff that we had to get done. I had hoped to have my house cleaned by when it was time to go. This obviously did not happen.We took the Greyhound from Spokane to Seattle… a stupid 7:30 minute ride. We didn’t know where we were going to stay, but found a pretty great hostel, <a href="http://www.greentortoise.net/">Green tortoise Hostel</a>. The room is clean, we have two other roommates (it’s dorm style). They had a great free dinner at which lots of the residents participated. I’ve met people already from Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Korea. They have some sort of activity everyday, today was a water balloon fight. The people seem pretty chill. Me and Trevor decided to wonder around Pike St. market and by the mall. We ended up at a pretty cool bar that had hundreds of taps posted on their walls. A pretty cool atmosphere.having not slept in about 48 hours, I think it is time to crash out and get ready to take off on our transcontinental flight in the morning.</p>

<p>I get off work in an hour and a half. In two hours I leave to take a 7.5 hour bus ride to Seattle. In one day I leave from Seattle and fly to Europe. The first leg of the journey is 9.5 hours, and lands in Copenhagen Denmark. From Copenhagen, it is a one hour flight to Berlin. Once in Europe I will be staying from August 18 till September 23 (five weeks). It’s a pretty exciting trip… but I don’t think it will really hit me until I’m actually there.</p>

<p>Since purchasing this domain name, and transferring all of it to here I have been going to though and giving the entire site a brief overhaul. I’ve had relatively limited experience with PHP. Since migrating my data, I have reduced it dramatically by utilizing the php language for includes for all the material that I add into each page. I have also added added and made a complete section for research and evidence based practice (link no longer valid). In completing this section I even utilized some JavaScript for the specific menu.</p>

<p>More than I have gotten done, I am still on the learning curve for some other projects on the site. For example I am attempting to be able to have an include file for my menu structure. The only problem is that I don’t want it to be static. I have struggled some with trying to implement cookies using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">setcookie()</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$_COOKIE</code> functions in php. I have had difficulty knowing how to debug it.</p>

<p>This would all change based on what specific page the viewer is on. I also loaded the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a> and have attempted to build applications both with that and google earth.</p>

<p>I think all of these overnights that I’m working is catching up with me. A couple of nights ago, I worked an overnight and then had stuff I had to do all morning. I didn’t fall asleep until like five or six pm. I think I was planning on just taking a nap, but slept until morning (like 12 hours). I just woke up from my most recent nap after working an overnight, going to sleep around one in the afternoon. Now it’s nine pm. I’m not exactly sure what I’m supposed to do, because I work in the morning. Do I attempt to go to sleep again in a couple of hours… so I still get a decent amount of sleep because I just got like eight hours. Maybe I’m just trying to get ahead in my sleep so that I’m ready for Europe. Maybe I’m just crazy.</p>

<p>I seem to work many overnights at the <a href="http://www.yfaconnections.org/">Crisis Residential Center</a>. I think this might be due to the fact that I have a fairly hectic schedule and those are the hours that they can fit in with mine. I also think that many of the other support staff do not put the overnight shift on their availability as often as I do. I think that I might be a little bit crazy, but I’m really willing to work pretty much whenever right now. I think as my life changes, so will this priority… but thus far, I really don’t have a family to take care of. With these overnights, I have not been able to log onto the center’s wireless due to password. I finally thought about it (only 5 or 6 months later) and realized that I could get the password off of the staff office computer downstairs. Anyways, now I can actually work on my homework (though blackboard), my web design, or what ever else I need to do in my life. This comes not any too soon, because I work five overnights this week before I go to Europe.</p>

<p>It might seem like I need to send my computer away, because I have been spending too much time on it. Currently my eyes and head hurt a bit, due to the fact that I have been spending hours and hours working on my computer. Currently I just finished wrapping my computer to be sent to HP Support, and writing a paper. I have had computer issues for the last several weeks. My wireless adapter is not working, something that will be vital in Europe. I thought at first it was a software issues (or drivers)… but after doing a complete system restore, this option was shown as not viable. Then I replaced the wireless adapter completely, but again no effect. This final step will probably do another complete system restore and either replace or re-image my mother board. Either way, I am currently stuck with a loaner computer from school and crossing my fingers that my computer will get back before I leave on my trip.</p>

<p>It seems like a lot of parts of my life are just like the blackberry bush picture, not quite ripe yet. I feel like I have had a lot of different things in my life that I have lost recently. For example the dance instructor training, the depth of my spirituality (i.e. I haven’t been going to church as much as I think I should), some relationships… etc. I feel like I’ve lost a lot recently. Other than having lost things, I’m also waiting for other things, especially my Europe trip, to know if I can do my practicum at the CRC, and just to see what my life is going to look like in the near future. I guess I have to agree with Tom Petty, and say that “The Waiting is the Hardest Part.”</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2008/8/dance-instructor-training">Saturday August 2, 2008</a> by <a href="/contact">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>I had aspirations of becoming a dance instructor for quite a while. During my Fall Quarter 2006 I had a friend who was taking a dance class at Eastern. I went with her and some other friends to the dance final and decided that I was hooked on dancing. The guy who teaches out at EWU also owns an excellent studio in Spokane (<a href="http://spokanedance.com/ (Spokane Dance Company)">Spokane Dance Company</a>). Since then I have taken ever dance class that I can, both at Eastern and at the studio. October 2007 I payed for and started participating in their Teacher Training Program. I took lots of classes and pasted a majority of my progress checks. between October and January. When classes started in the Winter my life got super hectic. I was working 30-40 hours a week at the CRC. I started doing my practicum that quarter too, working at the Juvenile about 30-60 hours a week. Furthermore I had a couple of classes I was taking. All in all, the studio took a second seat to everything I was doing.A couple of days ago, Glenn (the studio manager) asked me to meet with him. When I did, he told me that he had met with the studio’s board and they had decided that it was taking too long for me to make it though my progress checks. I was upset by this and relieved. It is nice to not feel guilty when I am unable to be at the studio. I also understand where they are coming from. I had used up all of the classes that I had payed for, and had been on a scholarship from the studio for a while. With just a few progress checks to go, I am no longer doing the instructor training program. I have no hurt feelings towards Glenn or the studio. I am grateful for the training that I have received and it was all a good experience. For all my friends at the studio, I hope to be able to come when I can. It might be a little while before I buy a new membership, because it’s been a while since I’ve had to have one. I don’t have any plans to purchase a new program from the studio anytime soon due to their costs and I paid for my teacher training in full already… which was fairly costly. But I hope to still see you all around.</p>
