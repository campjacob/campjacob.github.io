<p>Social workers all wear a number of different hats, or function in a number of different roles for their practice. In this video we talk about 15 different roles that social workers frequently put on. We go through and talk talk about the roles of counselor, case manager, broker, enabler, enabler, educator, facilitator, mediator, negotiator, manager, analyst/evaluator, consultant, integrator/coordinator, spokesperson, organizer/mobilizer, and advocate.</p>

<p>Helping the populations that we work with be able to connect together, feel as if they are in the same boat with persons with similar needs, and giving them opportunities to provide assistance to those persons is a effective way to help people feel supported. Mutual Aid groups are useful for all different types of needs, includes families of youth who have special needs. We discuss what Mutual Aid is and some of the ways that we facilitate groups with Mutual Aid as social workers.</p>

<p>Changing problematic behaviors is difficult. One evidence-based method for addressing difficult and disruptive behaviors whether at school or home is through reinforcing the behaviors that we want to see and punishing behaviors that we do not want to see. This general learning style is what is referred to as operant conditioning. For this video, we give some examples of how to provide these reinforcements and punishments.</p>

<p>We focus on an article published in the Journal on Pediatrics in 2011 written by the Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and the Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management. This article focuses on diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment.</p>

  <p>A Black Madonna or Black Virgin is a statue or painting of Mary in which she, and oftentimes the infant Yahshua are depicted with dark skin, especially those created in Europe in the medieval period or earlier. The Black Madonnas are generally found in Catholic and Orthodox countries. The term refers to a type of Marian statue or painting of mainly medieval origin (12th to 15th centuries), with dark or black features.</p>

<p>The city of lights was beautiful. You can find my photo album on Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100259365182336.1073741840.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=61670512fa">Paris, City of Lights</a>. After spending four nights in Paris, we caught a train heading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, in the Southern France region. In Toulouse, we didn’t really spend much time. We rented cars and spent a little bit of time getting some lunch and wandering around the Toulouse downtown for a bit. We tried to go and see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Madonna">Black Madonna</a>, but we couldn’t find parking. We rented two  cars, mine was a manual. I hadn’t driven a manual transmission car since I was in high school, but after we got into the windy roads of the French Countryside in Midi-Pyrénées, I was glad that was my car. It felt exhilarating to be shifting through all of the roads.</p>

<p>Heading to the Commune of Fabas, we went to the wrong Fabas at first (putting us about 45 minutes in the wrong direction), but we finally made it to some of the most wonderful country I’ve ever seen. We spent four nights in the area. My mom, Geralyn and I stayed at an old family friend of my mother and I, Sheila and Dennis. They used to live in the Dayton Watisburg area where I grew up. They built a house, in the countryside with the most spectacular view. You can check out photos on Facebook album, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100262325235366.1073741841.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=6d066c7b40">French Countryside in the Midi-Pyrénées</a>. We got the opportunity to do a lot of different things while we were there.</p>

<p>Steak Chevalier (Horse).</p>

<p>Before heading out on our trip, I was the least excited about visiting the countryside. I was thinking that I wouldn’t like it as much, because it is out of the city, but it was amazing! We spent one day touring various small villages, passes, and outlooks.  The views from the some of the passes, and Lake Bethmal were breathtaking. We even picked wild huckleberries on the mountain side. I was amazed at the roads, and sites especially knowing that often times the <a href="http://www.letour.com/us/">Tour de France</a> goes through these mountains. It made me tired just thinking about it. In the City of Seix, I ended up ordering horse (common food in France), it was good and tasted mostly like cow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1858 Lourdes rose to prominence in France and abroad due to the Marian apparitions seen by the peasant girl Bernadette Soubirous, who was later canonized. Shortly thereafter the city became one of the world’s most important sites of pilgrimage and religious tourism. Today Lourdes hosts around six million visitors every year from all corners of the world. This constant stream of pilgrims and tourists transformed quiet Lourdes into the second most important center of tourism in France, second only to Paris, and the third most important site of international Catholic pilgrimage after Rome and the Holy Land. As of 2011, of French cities only Paris had more hotel capacity.</p>

<p>View of the Church at Lourdes in France.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An estimated 200 million people have visited the shrine since 1860,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse">7</a> and the Roman Catholic Church has officially recognized 69 healings considered miraculous. Cures are examined using Church criteria for authenticity and authentic miracle healing with no physical or psychological basis other than the healing power of the water</p>

<p>Another one of the days, some of us went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes">Lourdes, France</a>. It was a bit of drive, but is an interesting town. There are hundreds of people with diseases, handicaps, and different abilities that make the pilgrimage to Lourdes to seek healing. The church of Lourdes, is gorgeous and I’m pretty sure it is what Disneyland is modeled after.</p>

<p>We also had an amazing five course traditional French meal at the bed and breakfast the rest of my family was staying at. The food was amazing, and we sat, ate, talked, ate, drank, ate, and drank more for almost three and half hours. A wonderful experience.</p>

<p>The next morning, we set off early, heading to Nice. When I told family and friends that I was going to France, everybody was worried because of the attack that happened about a month before our trip in Nice. It was unfortunate that we only got to stay one night in Nice, because it was a hip, vibrant, and fun town. We spent 10 hours driving from Sheila and Dennis to Nice, toll bridges, and craziness, but it was absolutely worth it.</p>

<p>Then it was a train to Florence with a stop in Milan. Our train was late arriving in Milan, and the carrier wouldn’t refund our ticket so we had to wait for another one and purchase it again.</p>

<p>In Florence we’ve had the opportunity see David, walk the streets, go shopping, I’ve gone out a couple of nights and gotten to experience some of the nightlife, and stay in an absolutely beautiful hotel (<a href="http://www.krafthotel.it">Kaft Hotel</a>) with a terrace roof and restaurant and pool. We leave tomorrow to head to the last leg of our trip and Rome.</p>

<p>Family European Adventure 2016 - Paris</p>

<p>It has been a fly by trip so far. My mom, my aunt Geralyn, my cousin Larissa and her boyfriend Shane, and my aunt Barbara and uncle Allen all have made her way over to Europe. Our first stop has been in Paris, the city of lights. It is a beautiful city, with amazing architecture, different little neighborhoods each with their own feel, wonderful architecture, and so many different people.</p>

<p>My mom and I left from the Pasco Airport to Seattle Tacoma Airport where we met up with the rest of our family. Then it was a 10.5 hour flight with a nine hour time difference (yes, we are living in the future). We have been walking a ton. I thought that it might be interesting to share how far we actually have been walking. I have been wearing my Apple Watch (which I absolutely love) the whole trip, so I have a pretty good idea of how far we’ve been walking each day so far.</p>

<p>We arrived in Paris after leaving Friday morning at 8:30 am on Saturday morning. It took a couple of hours to wait to go through customs and we found ourselves a taxi to our hotel, <a href="http://www.hotel-belle-juliette-paris.com/">Hotel &amp; Spa La Belle Juliette</a>. The hotel is somewhat expensive, and much more expensive then any hotels  that I would generally choose, but it is very chic with beautiful small rooms with iMacs in every room that double as a TV. After checking in, we were hungry and headed to <a href="http://www.lenemrod.com">Le Nemrod</a> to get some food and then made our way to a giant beautiful park to wander around a little bit. The <a href="http://www.senat.fr/visite/jardin/index.html">Jardin du Luxembourg</a> is absolutely a wonderful place to go, and really felt very much the epitome of what I imagine when I think of France. There was wonderful statues, old men playing chess and Bocci Ball, and many people just passing time with each other at a slow pace.</p>

<p>After wondering around the park for a couple of hours, playing some Pokémon Go (yes, you have to catch them all) and finding some pizza for dinner we made our way back to the hotel to relax and sleep after a sleepless two days.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/Cheap-food-and-fruit-at-the-Mouffetard-Market.jpeg" alt=" Cheap food and fruit at the Mouffetard Market. " /></p>

<p>Sunday, was a busy day with so many views of the city and little adventures along the way. We made our way to do some shopping and pick up some produce at the Mouffetard Market. Rue de Mouffetard and the market that is nearby is a little get away from modern life with cobble stones and small little stores all around. After doing a little shopping and resting our feet a little bit, we made our way to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthéon">Panthéon in Paris</a>. I will be posting a bunch of pictures from our trip on Facebook (and I’m sure I’ll share a link on here in the future), but the internet that I’ve mostly found has been fairly slow and difficult to upload. Just making this post with a couple of pictures has been a challenge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Panthéon is a building in the Latin Quarter in Paris. It was originally built as a church dedicated to St. Genevieve and to house the reliquary châsse containing her relics but, after many changes, now functions as a secular mausoleum containing the remains of distinguished French citizens. It is an early example of neoclassicism, with a façade modeled on the Pantheon in Rome, surmounted by a dome that owes some of its character to Bramante’s ‘Tempietto.’

<p>I got the opportunity to climb to the top of the Panthéon and take some really great shots of all of Paris. We walked down to the Zig Zag Café where I got the opportunity to try some Escargot for the first time and then we made our way to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris">Cathédrale Notre Dame</a>. Absolutely one of the best cathedrals that I’ve seen in my various trips. By night, we went to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>, and shared a bottle of some tequila as we walked home and so many laughs and fun times with my family.</p>

<p>Monday was a trip to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre">Louvre Museum</a>, some Jazz at <a href="http://www.sunset-sunside.com/">Sunset Subside</a> and sharing some checha at the Isis Café. Today has been mostly a relaxed day, and giving me an opportunity to share a little bit of our adventure with all of you. Here is looking forward to more stores as we go through France and Europe for the next couple of weeks. I will also be posting some photos to Facebook, so look forward to that.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2014/8/mileage-tracking-form-and-launch-center-pro">Friday November 14, 2014</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/track-your-trainings-learn-blocks.jpg" alt="Graphic of Blocks Saying Learn" title="Track Trainings for CEUs and Clock Hours Using Drafts 4 &amp; Launch Center Pro" /></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I spent some times further diving into <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> and <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>. Both are amazing applications for iOS, and have greatly improved my productivity and ability to get things done. I have been absolutely loving my <a href="/blog/2014/8/mileage-tracking-form-and-launch-center-pro">Milage Tracker</a> that I put together, and use it multiple times a day (and find that it makes it so I don’t forget to track). As I have written before, I’m a big fan of using plain <a href="/blog/2014/3/review-of-david-sparkss-markdown-book-an-investigation-to-formatting-documents">text files and Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>Several years ago, when I started working at Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services, and attending various trainings post MSW I started keeping a word document listing all of the various trainings that I attend. If you work in an industry that requires documentation regarding trainings received, hopefully you have started doing that too. I since have change my system around. I now have a plain text file that I keep on dropbox which has a listing of every training that I have received (whether that be in agency or for some sort of professional development certificate). As I have been looking towards applying for my <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/SocialWorker/LicenseRequirements/LicensedIndependentClinicalSocialWorker">LICSW</a> and having my <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/certification/ESAMain.aspx">ESA</a> which requires so many clock hours, I decided that I wanted to also have an easy way to calculate how many CEU’s or Clock Hours without combing through my long text file of all my trainings. I created two <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a> which I could open in Excel or Numbers and have calculate the total number of hours easily. The problem is, I didn’t want to have to write entries sometimes three times. I also wanted to be able to add these entries either from my phone or from my iPad easily when I get to the training. Never having to worry about it again.</p>

<p>With so many iOS automation tasks that I do, it starts in Launch Center Pro (LCP) for me. I have a main entry that collects data in several prompts (you <a href="https://launchcenterpro.com/t4zs0x">can install it</a>). The content is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>launch://x-callback-url/clipboard?text=[prompt:Review=[prompt:Date], [prompt:Training Title], [prompt-num:Number of CEUs or Clock Hours] [list:Type|Clock Hours=Clock Hours|CEUs=CEUs|Both=Clock Hours and CEUs], [list:Type of Units|Ethics= Professional Law and Ethics|Suicide=Suicide Assessment Treatment and Management|General=General Continuing Education Credits|None=|ESA Suicide=ESA Suicide Prevention Intervention Training]]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It creates a final review prompt that includes text regarding the training date, the title of the training, the number of hours, and the type of hours (i.e. Professional Law and Ethics or Suicide Assessment Treatment and Management).</p>

<p>I have this LCP action in my “base” actions folder along with a couple of different actions related to my trainings. All of them send the contents to Drafts for different actions. One action posts the clipboard to an action that appends it to my Clock Hour CSV, one to my CEU CSV, and one to my text file. I then have a main action that calls all of the other actions and let me select if I want to post it to one, two or all three of the actions.</p>

<p>The two actions that I have which append to my Clock Hour CSV and my CEU CSV files are very simple and just append to the files. There are two actions to append to my overall text file. One action takes the comma separated data and uses some JavaScript to split the text at each “, “ and return the text with each section as a new line. You can <a href="http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1NF">install the drafts action</a> or see the JavaScript below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// Function to Parse Comma Separated Value Text
// Jacob Campbell -- http://jacobrcampbell.com/

function parseText(s){
    var temp = new Array();
    temp = s.split(', ');
      var result = "";
      var i;
    for(i=0; i&lt;temp.length; i++) {
        result += temp[i] + "\n";
    }
return result;
}

// Commit content to draft

var text = draft.content;
draft.content = parseText(text);
commit(draft);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The drafts action then passes that data to another action which takes those new lines and adds it to a template page that has the following information:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>## [[line|2]]
* __Date__: [[line|1]]  
* __Location__:   
* __Facilitator__:   
* __CEU / Clock Hours__: [[line|3]], [[line|4]]  
* __Duration__:   
* __Certificate of Completion__:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each of the the parts that say <code class="highlighter-rouge">[[line|n]]</code> takes that line from the draft and puts it there. I then add the last little bit of information (i.e. location, who facilitated it… etc) and I’m all done.</p>

<p>What is amazing, is I can write it once in LCP, have it post to both CSV files and then prepare it for posting it to my text file with only typing minimal text. I have taken it to another level, and have made some OmniFocus task templates that I can post and remember to follow up and see if I have received my confirmation form for my clock hours.</p>

<p>If you have the need to track your clock hours or CEU’s its a pretty awesome system, and I’d highly encourage you steal what I have put together and change it for your own needs.</p>
