<p>Life has been busy lately, and I haven’t posted anything for a while. Most of my time has been taken up by working. I’m working as a Mental Health Case Manager at Nueva Esperanza a part of <a href="http://www.tcc-health.org/ (Tri-Cities Community Health)">Tri-Cities Community Health</a>. I have been really loving it. I’ve gotten lots of cool opportunities working there, and am learning a lot.</p>

<p>I’ve still been working at <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org (Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery)">Safe Harbor</a>. Next month, I will be starting to lead a group for pre-teens / teens. I’m pretty excited about it.</p>

<p>I also got to go to the social night out for <a href="http://www.youngprofessionalstc.org/ (Young Professionals of the Tri-Cities)">Young Professionals of the Tri-Cities</a>. It was nice to meet so many people of different organizations. I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to have some changes come to my website here in the near future.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2010/11/2010-beggars-banquet-excitement">Saturday November 20, 2010</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>On Friday, I got the opportunity to go to <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org (Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery)">Safe Harbor’s</a> annual Beggars Banquet. It was a really great event, and so much bigger then I’ve seen it. It had been several years since I was able to go to the last event, and it has changed drastically and really gave me some great prospective on doing some fundraising events. Years ago, when I last went they were in the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vqtv (Google Maps, Old Country Buffet)">Old Country Buffet</a>, maybe had a 100 people, and made something like $5,000. A lot has changed since I’ve come back to the Tri-Cities.</p>

<p>This years event, and last years for that matter, took place at the <a href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/ (Three Rivers Convention Center)">Three Rivers Convention Center</a>, a wonderful venue. The main feature of this annual event is local restaurants bring in their best soup. The event drew about 800 participants this year and a small army of volunteers. Volunteers even included Miss Tri-Cities and Miss Columbia Basin. I spent my time volunteering taking pictures of the event (although I didn’t load them on my laptop, so I’m not posting any as of yet). There was a silent auction of gift baskets and beautifully decorated Christmas trees. There was also a live auction of lots of cool items, with the hottest selling item being one of the board members preparing a five different dinners for groups of 8 people selling for I believe $500 a pop. Pretty amazing. They also had a number of drawings, raffles, and even a card game. They’ve really come up with some innovative ways of getting money, with even just a live donation time at the end. This year, before paying for all of the events costs, they came up with about $50,000, which is absolutely amazing! That’s about $20,000 more then they made the previous year.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2010/11/tri-cities-wine-festival">Tuesday November 9, 2010</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks have been pretty great. This last weekend was really fun. I got the opportunity to go to the 2010 Tri-Cities Wine Festival held at the <a href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/ (Three Rivers Convention Center)">Three Rivers Convention Center</a>. It was a really fabulous event. While the entrance was generally $65.00 to attend, I was able to get in for free. <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/ (Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery)">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a> was invited to the event to do a coat check for donations. I was able to go and spend a little bit of time tasting some wines before starting to collect coats. It was a lot of fun. When I was walking around (by myself at first), I ended up meeting two people. One was a lady from China who had gotten her Ph.D. from <a href="http://wsu.edu/ (Washington State University)">WSU</a> and a guy who was from Chile. I was really surprised to meet a couple of international persons in the Tri-Cities (I always feel like it’s such a small place). Especially the guy from Chile. We spent time talking about Pisco, and the rivalry between Peru and Chile. It was very interesting.</p>

<p>When I was doing the coat check it was kind of fun. I got to talk about Safe Harbor with a number of people and hear lots of people say they were familiar with our services. We even had a guy give a $100 donation into our tip jar. Pretty phenomenal.</p>

<p>I get to go into my orientation here tomorrow for Tri-Cities Community Health. It seems like things are getting into place.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/media/walk-score-screenshot.jpg" alt=" This is a screen shot of the  Walk Score  for my mom's house. It's pretty interesting. It comes up with a score of 30, and being car dependent. I would have to agree. " /> This is a screen shot of the Walk Score for my mom’s house. It’s pretty interesting. It comes up with a score of 30, and being car dependent. I would have to agree.</p>

<p>This last week has been a really good one for me. I just got hired on at Tri-Cities Community Health (formerly Community Health Center La Clinca) as a case manager, which should be really fun. I’m not exactly sure what I’ll be doing, but I’m assuming it will be a great learning experience.</p>

<p>The other thing that is very cool is that I just got a car. I’ve been looking at apartments, and I came across a really interesting website (<a href="http://walkscore.com/">Walk Score</a>). The website lets you enter an address and it rates how walkable that address is (i.e. closeness of stores, entertainment, public transportation… etc). It’s a really interesting concept and something which is very on my mind since coming back from Peru.</p>

<p>Since coming back from Peru, one thing that has been hard to get used to is how much space / how spread out everything is in the US and especially in Tri-Cities. The neighbor hood that my mom lives in is not very walkable, scoring just a 30. I can believe this. The other day, my mom asked me if I could get some bread. I ended up walking to the nearest Albertsons, it only took me about 2 hours to go there and back. I think that this idea of a walk score is also important because of it’s effect on the climate and feel of a city.</p>

<p>If things are more walkable in a city I believe that people are more likely to walk. It’s healthier for the people in the community. It’s healthier for the environment. And it’s healthier for the community. It would make sense that if you are walking to various locations in your community you are more likely to know / meet people who live around you. Knowing your neighbors builds community solidarity and makes it a safer place to live.</p>

<p>I bring this up because of my other piece of cool news. I was going to go and buy a car. I figured with the income that I would be making and spreading it out over three years (normal car payment) I could easily afford a car payment for a $10,000 car. I found some really great cars. I found a 2001 Mercedes (fully loaded) that was super sexy that was under $10,000. Pretty amazing. While I would be able to afford the loan, and it would be a really fun car to own, one of my mom’s friends offered to give me a car for FREE. So amazing. While it’s not as sexy as a Mercedes, being a 1993 Mercury Sable Wagon, it is amazing to receive it for free… such a blessing. It does have some problems with it, and I need to get it in somewhere so it can get looked at, it is a free car. It will allow me to save up some money until I can have a better down payment (or pay cash) for a new car. The car doesn’t have AC, but during the winter that shouldn’t be a problem so maybe next summer I’ll look into getting a new car. I was just so excited, that I wanted to share with everyone.</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2010/10/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-promotional-video">Friday October 29, 2010</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>I really enjoy doing a little bit of graphic and web design, it seems like a good hobby. Sometimes it can take up just a little bit too much time, but I generally enjoy it (unless it’s one of those times that I just can’t seem to get my computer to do what I see in my head.</p>

<p>So, I guess more than graphic and web design now, I’ve made my first movie. Well, maybe it’s not really my first movie, but one of my first “real movie.” I’ve put together slide shows and that sort of thing a couple of times in <a href="http://goo.gl/a8RO (Window's Live Movie Maker)">Windows Live Movie Maker</a>. It’s a super easy to use program, and has served my purposes well. When I was asked to create a promotional video for <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org (Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery)">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a> I figured I’d play around with the untouched <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/ (Adobe Premier Pro)">Adobe Premier Pro</a> I have on my computer and see what I could do. While the video is probably about the same type of quality that I could have made with the basic windows program, it was interesting to learn a little bit about another design type.</p>

<p>So below is the video I created for Safe Harbor and loaded on YouTube (<a href="http://youtu.be/Xjuu5fpbAKc (View on YouTube)">View video on YouTube</a>) for your viewing pleasure. I must say the video is not the best quality, but I guess it works for my first attempt. If any of you have any helpful tips for making it better, let me know.</p>

    </h1>

<p>Posted on <a href="/blog/2010/10/creative-giving">Monday October 11, 2010</a> by <a href="/contact/">Jacob Campbell</a>.</p>

<p>I think that creativity and ideas are everywhere for us, we just have to tap into them. It also seems that it is easy to come up with ideas about things to spend money on, when one doesn’t have any money to spend.</p>

<p>I went to McDonald’s tonight for a snack, kind of a long story, and spent some of the last couple of dollars I have on some McChicken Sandwiches. This got me thinking about how their only a buck. Buying two of them was sufficient for my stomach (probably not if I was super hungry…). This got me thinking about what if I just bought like 100 of them (or 50) and gave them out to homeless people (although this would probably work better in Spokane then here in the Tri-Cities).</p>

<p>I am a firm believer in giving. I think it is a great thing, and even though I’ve never made a lot of money working, I’ve always given. This is normally my tithe, and I’ve given to various organizations, and given lots of my time. I think it would be cool to, after I get a job probably, put into my budget a “Creative Giving” category. On my budget I generally take out 20% of my gross income. I pay myself first with 10% and tithe 10%. Then I’ve in the past had some different things that I’ve given to with some extra money.</p>

<p>If I could have this “Creative Giving” category, and maybe only put $50 into it every month. I would want to require that I come up with a new creative way to give away that money every month. It seems to be a really interesting idea, but probably not worth that much coming from somebody who had to gather change to pay a $2.17 late night dinner at McDonald’s, we’ll have to see if when I have an income I put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>I want to know, if someone gave you $50 and told you that you had to come up with a creative idea on how to give it away…. what would you do with it?</p>

<p>Other then the job hunt, I’ve been spending some time online working on my website. Well, actually (not consistently) for the last several weeks I’ve been trying to figure out one thing. Not even a very important thing, but something that I wanted done. Basically I wanted to make it so that when I write a blog post, I can enter where I wrote it from. Then I wanted this to display on the right sidebar. Well, after too much work… I finally got it. Not to maybe go back through and put the data into all my older posts. But enjoy knowing where I wrote my posts from it only took lots of hours to make it all possible.</p>

I feel kind of like Elmer Fudd and never finding my wabit</p>

<p>Since I’ve been back in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-Cities,_Washington">Tri-Cities</a>, I’ve been up to quite a bit. Mainly I’ve been focused on looking for a job, which the job search is always exciting. I’ve had some luck. I have my first interview scheduled for Thursday. It’s at Nueva Esperanza Counseling Center in Pasco (a division of the <a href="http://www.mytcch.org/">Community Health Center: La Clinica</a>). I would be a Counseling Case Manager. It sounds like the job would be working at a detox center.</p>

<p>I’ve put my application in maybe eight or 10 places so far. One place that seems to have a lot of hope would be at the <a href="http://www.esd123.org/">Educational Service District 1 2 3</a>. I have a friend that works for the Pasco School district who has been talking to their director on my behalf, which is a really sweet deal. You know what they say, sometimes it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. I think in my case, I have both going for me. I would be a prevention / intervention specialist for middle school students. It would be a great job, and I’d probably be able to work with what my friend just called little “thuglettes.”</p>

<p>The other place of note that I’ve applied for (well, in the process) is for <a href="http://dshs.wa.gov">DSHS</a>. Actually I’m applying for a couple of jobs there. One that would be cool is working with low-income / homeless people. It would be a bit stretching, because it’s mainly with the elderly. But I have really enjoyed doing work with the homeless, so that would be really cool. I also like the possibility of it’s a regional job, so I believe I’d be traveling all over Eastern Washington. This means that I could probably see my friends from all over too. Plus the job pays really really well, like just under $5,000 to just under $6,000 a month. I was talking to my mom, and she’s never had a job that paid that much before. I think I could pay off my student loans pretty quick if I was doing that.</p>

<p>I’ve been putting my application in all over (I’ve mainly been looking right now in Tri-Cities, because I have a pretty sweet possible rent deal for a 2 bedroom house for only $200 per month or so) but also plan to look in Portland, and Spokane… and wherever else I can find a job. Other than the job hunt, I’ve been trying to see some old friends. A year is a long time to be away. If I haven’t gotten the chance to hang out with you yet, give me a call. I have the same number. It’s nothing personal, I’ve just been focused on job hunting. Figure I need to have some money coming in. Speaking of which, I went and donated plasma for the first time in several years! It’s only $30, but when you have no money it’s a lot.</p>

<p>I’ve also have been playing around with my computer. I created my first theme for my BlackBerry. It was made really quickly (in like 30 minutes or so), but I’m in process of making what will hopefully be a really cool one. When I finish, I’ll post it (maybe I’ll even sell it for like $00.99…).</p>

<p>Like I said, if I haven’t had the chance to hang out with you… give me a call or wait around a bit and I’ll get around to calling you.</p>
