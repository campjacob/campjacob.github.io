&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still figuring out how I want to share more personal things about my life. While I’m still currently on Facebook (and probably this post will be shared there), I almost never post there. I’ve actually turned off the notifications (other than for messenger). Sometimes I post to Instagram, but that seems somewhat rare as well. I probably most frequently post things to Snapchat, as I like that it just disappears, but I don’t really have many friends there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I share photos sometimes directly with people through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209035&quot;&gt;Sharing Suggestions in Photos&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m still figuring it out. I have a couple hundred photos and video’s I took while we were in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leavenworth,_Washington&quot;&gt;Leavenworth area&lt;/a&gt; over Memorial Day. I wanted to share share something, so I put together this video using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275&quot;&gt;Quik App on my iPad&lt;/a&gt;, which is such and easy way to put together a pretty neat looking video quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also also see some some of the photos from our trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the opportunity to stay in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/30254693&quot;&gt;Jack’s Cabin&lt;/a&gt;, through airbnb which was a phenomenal experience.

I feel the work that I get to do is meaningful and really get to make an impact on the lives to staff and students. One of the reasons why it feels so meaningful to me is that fact that we try (while we don’t always implement) to use best practices to address our students needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I got the opportunity to join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wassw.org&quot;&gt;Washington State Association of School Social Workers&lt;/a&gt; and attend their annual conference. One of the presenters there from OSPI talked about the upcoming Student Support Conference and described that they would be making a request for proposals for conference presenters. I decided that I wanted to stretch myself some, although this is not the first conference that I have spoken at, and apply to present about our program and the best practices for classrooms serving students with emotional and behavioral disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/media/foundational-aspects-evidence-based-classrooms-presentation.pdf&quot;&gt;the slides from my presentation&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://noti.st/campjacob/FhBMCJ&quot;&gt;view on Notist&lt;/a&gt;) and I figured that I would share it hear as well. You can see more information about the conference at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.k12.wa.us/StudentSupport/default.aspx&quot;&gt;OSPI’s Student Support Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little bit late tonight, but I will also say that while I didn’t get the opportunity to stay for both days of the conference (I had some other stuff come up that I really had to do), the other presentations that I got to sit in on were great and it’s good to see how much focus on both mental health and trauma there is for our students.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jacob Campbell</name></author><category term="Social Work" /><category term="Conference" /><category term="Presentation" /><category term="Pasco School District" /><category term="Emotional and Behavioral Disabilities" /><category term="Notist" /><category term="L-- Wenatchee Washington" /><summary type="html">Information from conference presentation for OSPI’s 2019 Student Support Conference - Better Together: Collaboration, Coordination, and Compassion</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Privilege It’s a Thing and We Should Care</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/04/privilege-its-a-thing-and-we-should-care/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Privilege It's a Thing and We Should Care" /><published>2019-04-15T13:19:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-04-15T13:19:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/04/privilege-its-a-thing-and-we-should-care</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/04/privilege-its-a-thing-and-we-should-care/">&lt;p&gt;Privilege is a topic that has been coming up and that I’ve been mulling over recently. I am a true believer that it is a topic that we should keep coming back to and reevaluating what our privilege is. When I was working on my degrees in social work at Eastern Washington University, I wrote a paper &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/articles/ethnicity-non-ethnicity&quot;&gt;The Ethnicity of Non-Ethnicity: The Ethnic Autobiography of the Dominate Culture&lt;/a&gt; back in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacob says &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-thumbs-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;br /&gt; A powerful story

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been planning writing a review about Ta-Nehishi Coates audio book, Between The Worlds and Me, which I recently listened to (and I think think this blog post will suffice). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/books/review-in-between-the-world-and-me-ta-nehisi-coates-delivers-a-desperate-dispatch-to-his-son.html&quot;&gt;Michiko Kakutani From the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; provides a good review of the book which is written as a type of letter to Coates’s teenage son about the realities, feelings, and symbolism associated with being Black in the United States. There were many points that stood out to me and gave me pause to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coates was talking about his years growing up, and the safety of his body, really struck me that even with all of my travels and sometimes dangerous positions, that I’ve not really lived in it and my privilege that frequently they were positions I had put myself in. I was also struck by his comments about people who “think they are white.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a powerful story and well worth a read or a listen. If you do listen to it like I did (and I must give a shoutout to public libraries and being able to download audiobooks), I love books that read by the author as I feel like I get even more of their voice. I was thankful that my mom recommended it to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While, I still haven’t finished the episode yet, I am still working my way through listening to Reconcilable Differences - Episode 101: Duke of Bits (&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+E5IPI_acI&quot;&gt;Overcast Link&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/rd/101&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;). I highly respect John and Merlin and appreciate their thoughtfulness in life and the way they broach all sorts of topics. In this episode they talk about both privilege and status and it was a great listen and through provoking. It is so important, as they said that people recognize that privilege is a thing and we have to keep reminding ourselves of that. The idea that how we can be fearless to be able to go about our life, and know that everything will be ok. That is so true for me and I can highly relate to saying that many times I can be fearless where not everybody else can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/what-makes-you-so-fearless.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graphic stating what makes you so fearless&quot; title=&quot;What makes you so fearless&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area I’m able to be somewhat fearless in is pursing more education. I’m sure I will write more about this as time goes on, but I’ve been accepted to the California Institute of Integral Studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ciis.edu/academics/graduate-programs/transformative-studies&quot;&gt;Doctorate in Transformative Studies&lt;/a&gt; program. The mere fact that I can look into pursing this puts me in such a position of privilege. And while I don’t have the type of excessive privilege of the somewhat recent news about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/03/12/702539140/u-s-accuses-actresses-others-of-fraud-in-wide-college-admissions-scandal&quot;&gt;U.S. Charges Dozens Of Parents, Coaches In Massive College Admissions Scandal&lt;/a&gt; I still have a whole lot more than many people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jacob Campbell</name></author><category term="Resources" /><category term="Book Review" /><category term="Podcasts" /><category term="L-- Tri-Cities Washington" /><summary type="html">All of the areas that privilege seems to be coming up in my life these days.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Is it Spring Yet?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like Spring is finally here. We went to the Duck Pond at Columbia Park and fed the ducks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say, after I was posting about buying bread to feed the ducks, a friend reached out to me and told me about the problems related to that, so you should consider feeding them something else. Fun video though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social workers all wear a number of different hats, or function in a number of different roles for their practice. In this video we talk about 15 different roles that social workers frequently put on. We go through and talk talk about the roles of counselor, case manager, broker, enabler, enabler, educator, facilitator, mediator, negotiator, manager, analyst/evaluator, consultant, integrator/coordinator, spokesperson, organizer/mobilizer, and advocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing problematic behaviors is difficult. One evidence-based method for addressing difficult and disruptive behaviors whether at school or home is through reinforcing the behaviors that we want to see and punishing behaviors that we do not want to see.

&lt;p&gt;A look into how to address Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from the perspectives of clinicians, parents, and schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focus on an article published in the Journal on Pediatrics in 2011 written by the Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and the Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management. This article focuses on diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with vulnerable population is a staple for social workers. Discussion about types of policy practice (including policy-sensitive practice, policy-related practice, and policy advocacy) and some real life examples of participating in policy advocacy through legislative advocacy, social advocacy, and policy analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A Black Madonna or Black Virgin is a statue or painting of Mary in which she, and oftentimes the infant Yahshua are depicted with dark skin, especially those created in Europe in the medieval period or earlier. The Black Madonnas are generally found in Catholic and Orthodox countries. The term refers to a type of Marian statue or painting of mainly medieval origin (12th to 15th centuries), with dark or black features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city of lights was beautiful. You can find my photo album on Facebook, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100259365182336.1073741840.44504407&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;l=61670512fa&quot;&gt;Paris, City of Lights&lt;/a&gt;. After spending four nights in Paris, we caught a train heading to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse&quot;&gt;Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;, in the Southern France region. In Toulouse, we didn’t really spend much time. We rented cars and spent a little bit of time getting some lunch and wandering around the Toulouse downtown for a bit. We tried to go and see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Madonna&quot;&gt;Black Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, but we couldn’t find parking. We rented two  cars, mine was a manual. I hadn’t driven a manual transmission car since I was in high school, but after we got into the windy roads of the French Countryside in Midi-Pyrénées, I was glad that was my car. It felt exhilarating to be shifting through all of the roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading to the Commune of Fabas, we went to the wrong Fabas at first (putting us about 45 minutes in the wrong direction), but we finally made it to some of the most wonderful country I’ve ever seen. We spent four nights in the area. My mom, Geralyn and I stayed at an old family friend of my mother and I, Sheila and Dennis. They used to live in the Dayton Watisburg area where I grew up. They built a house, in the countryside with the most spectacular view. You can check out photos on Facebook album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100262325235366.1073741841.44504407&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;l=6d066c7b40&quot;&gt;French Countryside in the Midi-Pyrénées&lt;/a&gt;. We got the opportunity to do a lot of different things while we were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before heading out on our trip, I was the least excited about visiting the countryside. I was thinking that I wouldn’t like it as much, because it is out of the city, but it was amazing! We spent one day touring various small villages, passes, and outlooks.  The views from the some of the passes, and Lake Bethmal were breathtaking. We even picked wild huckleberries on the mountain side. I was amazed at the roads, and sites especially knowing that often times the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letour.com/us/&quot;&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; goes through these mountains. It made me tired just thinking about it. In the City of Seix, I ended up ordering horse (common food in France), it was good and tasted mostly like cow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In 1858 Lourdes rose to prominence in France and abroad due to the Marian apparitions seen by the peasant girl Bernadette Soubirous, who was later canonized. Shortly thereafter the city became one of the world’s most important sites of pilgrimage and religious tourism. Today Lourdes hosts around six million visitors every year from all corners of the world. This constant stream of pilgrims and tourists transformed quiet Lourdes into the second most important center of tourism in France, second only to Paris, and the third most important site of international Catholic pilgrimage after Rome and the Holy Land. As of 2011, of French cities only Paris had more hotel capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An estimated 200 million people have visited the shrine since 1860,&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; and the Roman Catholic Church has officially recognized 69 healings considered miraculous. Cures are examined using Church criteria for authenticity and authentic miracle healing with no physical or psychological basis other than the healing power of the water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one of the days, some of us went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes&quot;&gt;Lourdes, France&lt;/a&gt;. It was a bit of drive, but is an interesting town. There are hundreds of people with diseases, handicaps, and different abilities that make the pilgrimage to Lourdes to seek healing. The church of Lourdes, is gorgeous and I’m pretty sure it is what Disneyland is modeled after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had an amazing five course traditional French meal at the bed and breakfast the rest of my family was staying at. The food was amazing, and we sat, ate, talked, ate, drank, ate, and drank more for almost three and half hours. A wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we set off early, heading to Nice. When I told family and friends that I was going to France, everybody was worried because of the attack that happened about a month before our trip in Nice. It was unfortunate that we only got to stay one night in Nice, because it was a hip, vibrant, and fun town. We spent 10 hours driving from Sheila and Dennis to Nice, toll bridges, and craziness, but it was absolutely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was a train to Florence with a stop in Milan. Our train was late arriving in Milan, and the carrier wouldn’t refund our ticket so we had to wait for another one and purchase it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Florence we’ve had the opportunity see David, walk the streets, go shopping, I’ve gone out a couple of nights and gotten to experience some of the nightlife, and stay in an absolutely beautiful hotel (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krafthotel.it&quot;&gt;Kaft Hotel&lt;/a&gt;) with a terrace roof and restaurant and pool. We leave tomorrow to head to the last leg of our trip and Rome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jacob Campbell</name></author><category term="Travel" /><category term="Family European Adventure 2016" /><category term="Family Fun" /><category term="L-- Midi-Phyrénées France" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
