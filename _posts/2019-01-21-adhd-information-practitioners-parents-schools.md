A look into how to address Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) from the perspectives of clinicians, parents, and schools. 

We focus on an article published in the Journal on Pediatrics in 2011 written by the Subcommittee on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and the Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management. This article focuses on diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment.
