I created this video, [Cooperative Transformation](https://youtu.be/nQ2NFbhkn9c) as a part of my class at [CIIS TSD](https://www.ciis.edu/academics/graduate-programs/transformative-studies)'s [Creativity and Personal Transformation](https://www.ciis.edu/academics/course-descriptions/creativity-and-personal-transformation) course. The class has been a wonderful experience to have taken this semester. Not only have I been able to learn more about creativity, myself, and transformation, but it has been personally useful to me as we are going through all of the stuff regarding this pandemic.

To create the video, it was a fairly involved process. The drone footage was filmed with my [DJI Spark](https://www.dji.com/spark) at the [Juniper Dunes Wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper_Dunes_Wilderness). I filmed it a couple of days ago, and was surprised that there were so many people out there riding their ATVs. I guess it just opened. I had been just driving looking for somewhere I could film at, and ended up seeing a sign and deciding I should go out there. A couple of months ago, I purchased [Micro Greens](https://backtotheroots.com/collections/microgreens-grow-kits-and-planters/products/microgreen-grow-kit-variety-3-pack) and set up my laptop to connect to my [GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/us/update/hero-2018) and take photos two times per hour. I also bought some [mushrooms](https://backtotheroots.com/collections/mushroom-grow-kits/products/mushroom-grow-kit) and tried setting up an old iPad to do the same timelapse video for it as well, but my set up kept turning off every couple of hours, and I couldn't get it to work. Unfortunately, I think my lighting and set up was better for the mushrooms as I was planning on that being the primary project.

The music track behind my voice is something I created. You can listen to just the song.

If you are interested, you can download the [GarageBand file in a zip archive](/assets/media/cooperative-transformation-garageband-song-project.zip) and edit yourself. I'm not super satisfied with it, but its fun to make music, and even somebody with no real talent/experience can create something that sounds decent.

Cooperative Transformation

> “There’s a loneliness that only exists in one’s mind. The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.”
> - F. Scott Fitzgerald

The worldwide crisis that has been caused by COVID-19 has been extremely turbulent and will continue to be disruptive. It has been a time filled with crisis and turmoil for many. It has been a challenging time for everybody, but some more than others. It is a time that we can feel very alone. As we are practicing social distancing and dealing with grief and loss, it can be isolating.

It has also been a time that is developing connection and togetherness. In this time, we must be in alliance with one another. The process of transformation is destructive. The old must leave, and a new must come. This process is challenging and requires sacrifice. I hope to impart a desire and encouragement for connection and interdependence.  We must not forget about those around us who might be in need. That we must develop cooperation that can change the world, let us leave this pandemic with a greater appreciation and higher level of compassion for each other. We must become better than we were before this started.

Together we can!

You can see my set up for filming the microgreens growing.

Along with a photo of the script I wrote in the [Camera Suite](https://www.camerasuite.org) app on my Mac, I used to connect to my GoPro. Speaking of this, its pretty awesome software, and even though my GoPro isn't supported and isn't supposed to help this type of implementation, it still worked.

I recorded my voice using a [ZOOM H4n Pro](https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/h4n-pro-handy-recorder) and edited it all together using [LumaFusion](https://luma-touch.com/lumafusion-for-ios-2/) on my iPad.
