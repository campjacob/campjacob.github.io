A video I made in [iMovie][1] from my [iPhone 5][2] Video Camera. It uses [Lenny Kravitz Fly Away][3]) for the music and features Mateo trying to escape from our home.

After taking Mateo's 10 moth pictures, I filed this movie and edited it with iMovie. It was kind of fun, and didn't take more then a couple of hours. The Monthly Photo Project has been kind of a fun project and we are getting close to the tail end of it.
