Tonight I sat around the hostel most of the night. I think I’m coming down with a cold, which is a stupid thing to have happen when your traveling. After eating a Kabob (the most excellent type of vendor food out there), a couple of us sat down a watched a movie. I’ve been dowsing myself with green tea, hoping to fend off this cold quickly. While checking stuff online, I stumbled across [Google’s new Google Chrome Browser][1]. I have been a strong supporter of [FireFox][2] as a default browser. But a new browser coming from Google might change my stance. I spent the last 15 or 20 minutes reading the [Comic Book description of the browser][3]. It was very interesting and something I’d recommend to anybody that has a bit of a technology-geek inside of them. I was fairly convinced about the new browser. It will be a while for me to test it out and see what I really think once I get home, but I might have to change.
