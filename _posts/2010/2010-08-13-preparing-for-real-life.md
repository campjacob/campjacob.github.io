My adventures in South America seem to be coming to a close, at least of now (hopefully I'll be back in a couple of years after paying off my student loans). It's been a wonderful trip. While I've been living in Cusco, I've been building up a bit of a movie collection of movies. DVD's are super expensive in the US, but here I can buy a DVD for S/. 2.00 ([about $0.72][2]). The latest addition to my collection has been the three original Indiana Jones moves. Watching [Raiders of the Lost Ark][3] made me think about my adventures here. While I haven't found any lost Inca artifacts, I have had lots of interesting experiences.

This said, it's time for me to return to the US. I still don't know what I'll be doing or where I'll be living, I've been working on that some. I've been looking for jobs online hoping to make my transition back to the US as easy as possible. I've also been spending considerable time updating my [website][4]. I've changed the complete format and I'm getting much more satisfied with how everything looks aesthetically.

I have a bus ticket for Thursday (09/09/10) from Cusco to Lima. While I'm not looking forward to the 24 hour bus ride, hopefully there won't be any protests. On Sunday the 12th I fly from Lima to Las Vegas. I'll be spending 5 days in Vegas. There's a really great airlines that flies to Vegas for really cheap. On [Allegiant Air][5] you can fly to from Vegas to Pasco for like $25. It's really a beautiful thing. The only problem is that they don't fly everyday. I'll have to wait for five days. I'm planning on [Couch Surfing][6] while I'm there so it shouldn't be too expensive. And while it would be fun to visit all of the casinos and see the shows, I'm pretty sure that I won't have money for that. That means on Friday the 17th, I'll be back in the Tri-Cities. I plan on visiting (moving back to...) Spokane soon, so you can all look forward to that.
