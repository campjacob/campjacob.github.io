With the bit of snow that we've gotten today, I'm actually kind of excited for the winter weather. It should be nice and I'm hoping for some more snow to come. I made a couple of videos last February (2019), and I realized I didn't post them to YouTube / my website.

This first one is made using [Quick](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275) and shot on my GoPro and my iPhone. It features a mini trip to go sledding at Carmichael Hill. The Music soundtrack is Daisy.
