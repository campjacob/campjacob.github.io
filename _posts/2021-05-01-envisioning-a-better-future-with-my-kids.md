Following on the concepts of Rob Hopkin's Book, [_From What is to What If: Unleashing the Power of Imagination to Create the Future We Want_](https://www.robhopkins.net/the-book/) and a thought experiment proposed by Donella Meadows' [speech](https://vimeo.com/30752926) at Third Biennial Meeting of the International Society for Ecological Economics. You can also find the transcript of the [1994 speech](http://donellameadows.org/archives/envisioning-a-sustainable-world/).

It was a fun project to do, but I have determined it is so much harder than I thought to make a documentary-style video.
