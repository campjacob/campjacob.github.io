[The Motorcycle Diaries (2004)][2] is about two men from Buenos Aires who make plans to travel by motorcycle travel around the coast of South America. The story comes from journey and written memoir of the 23-year-old Ernesto ("Che") Guevara. [Che Guevara][3] years later become internationally known as the iconic Marxist revolutionary. The film recounts the 1952 journey, initially by motorcycle, across South America by Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado. As the adventure centered around youthful hedonism unfolds, Guevara discovers himself transformed by his observations of the life of the impoverished indigenous peasantry. The road presents Ernesto Guevara and Alberto Granado a genuine picture of the Latin American identity. Through the characters they encounter on the road, Guevara and Granado learn the injustices the impoverished face and are exposed to people they would have never encountered in their hometown. The trip serves to expose a Latin American identity as well as explore the identity of one of its most memorable revolutionaries. This description changed from [Wikipedia entry][4]

I watched this movie last night with my friend who I am going to be traveling around South America with. It was a powerful movie, and one that I highly recommend for anybody to watch. Watching it, made me think about my upcoming trip, and what some of my expectations/reasons for going are. The following is some of what these are

  * **Learn Spanish**: When I was in [Barcelona Spain][5] during my [European Excursion][6], it was the place linguistically I felt the most comfortable. I want to be able to come back fluent, especially able to counsel and work with people I might other wise have had a language barrier.
  * **Meet/See/Do**: I've been very fortunate in my life to travel and see lots of the world. Already in my life I've been to four of the six continents I want to see (I have no desire to go to Antarctica). I love the feeling of being on the road. During my travels I've gotten to meet so many different people, that have improved and influenced my life. As I've gone places, the people have opened up my heart and encouraged me. I've also seen some of the most beautiful sights all around the world. I love seeing new places, and learning about the history and culture.
  * **Sort of a Sabbatical**: Sense graduating from High School, I have been working on preparing myself for my career for the last seven years. I spent two years involved in a leadership training/discipleship program called the [Master's Commission][7]. After that I went to [community college][8] and earned my AA, transferred to [Eastern Washington University][9] and first earned my BA in Social Work and now most recently my master's degree in social work. I think it is fitting to spend a year traveling and refocusing for my return and beginning of my career.
  * **Finding Direction**: I don't feel like I'm running away scared from my future, but I don't know really what the next step is for me. I think the traditional concept for after graduation is to start "real life." I don't like the idea of this. I feel like we should live/love the moments we are at in life. We don't have any time other than the now. I don't feel ready for things like getting a career job, buying a house, getting married, having a dogâ€¦ etc. OK, dog thing sounds good, but I'm just not ready for the rest.
  * **Letting The World Change Me**: Just like in the movie the Motorcycle Diaries, I am hoping that the experience will change me and prepare me to go out and change the world.
