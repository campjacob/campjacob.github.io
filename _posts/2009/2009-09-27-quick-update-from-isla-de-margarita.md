While traveling sometimes, it seems like I might spend too much time on my computer. Especially because I am a bit of a perfectionist, I take quite a bit of time to get any one thing finished. I was hoping to write about some of my experiences over the last weekâ€¦ but it's just taken way too long to get everything done (so hopefully tomorrow). It's already almost 11pm here in Venezuela, and I have a 6am boating excursion in the morning. I did figure that I would leave you with a couple of things. I'm making a list of all my posts, and other facts (including my Google Maps trip viewer) at a page on my blog ([Jaunt Down South][1]). I have uploaded my pictures so far from [Venezuela, Entering a Whole New World Facebook Album][2]. I have also updated places that we have been on my Google Maps:

So happy viewing and I will write more soon.
