The National Association of Social Workers (NASW, 2021) code of ethics defines six values: service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence. The ethical principle commissioning social workers to challenge injustice runs at the core of being a social worker. 

Injustice and inequity are built into the very fabric of our institutions,  policies, and culture. The history and impact of this goes beyond the scope of this short essay. The mandate for social workers to promote social change on behalf of oppressed and marginalized populations is at the heart of antiracist practice. The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE, 2022) educational policy and accreditation standards includes that social workers are to demonstrate, is to engage in anti-racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion (ADEI) as their third competency.

Policies and practices related to DEI (e.g.,  only including diversity, equity, and inclusion) might be a more widely used acronym. On the national stage and in many states, the topic of DEI and the concept of critical race theory is considered by some a polarizing topic and there is a great deal of misinformation and rhetoric. I appreciate that social work went beyond espousing DEI to explicitly include a focus on our experience as social workers to combat oppression. In developing this newsletter, our facility determined that each issue we want to discuss the topic of ADEI. 

Knowing the concept of anti-racism is not always included in the conversation, spending time defining what it means to be antiracist would be a helpful place to start. If you haven't read Kendi's (2023) book _How to Be an Antiracist_, I highly recommend it. I found his definitions helpful in framing what is racist or antiracist.

| Racist                                                                                                                                               | Antiracist                                                                                                                   |

| One who is expressing an idea of racial hierarchy, or through actions or inaction is supporting a policy that leads to racial inequity or injustice. | One who is expressing an idea of racial equality, or is actively supporting a policy that leads to racial equity or justice. |

(Chapter 1 Definitions, para. 1)

Kendi defines racism and antiracism as a dichotomy. Either you are actively working against racism, or you aren't (whether through action or inaction). He describes these titles as non-permanent, and they can be placed (like a peelable name tag) and changed based on what we are doing or not doing.

There is no middle ground or space for apathy. In our everyday actions are we doing things that promote racial equality? There is no space or place for apathy or inaction. As laws are passed or policies are implemented, this can be a measuring stick that we use to define whether it is working toward a more just and equitable future or not. Social workers can engage in antiracist work as we go about policy advocacy, clinical practice, community work, and social work in schools and everywhere we practice. How can you keep the antiracist sticker on?
