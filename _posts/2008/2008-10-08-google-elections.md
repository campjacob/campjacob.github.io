I must say that I am slightly biased as to which online products I like for various activities. I recently came across [Google 2008 U.S. Elections][1]. This has many different Google products that bring up various election features. One of these that I think is very cool is the Google Maps Elections â€˜08 Map Gallery. One example of the maps that are available is Candidate Queries Map from Google, but their is a host of other ones listed in the gallery.
