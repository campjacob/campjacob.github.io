I get off work in an hour and a half. In two hours I leave to take a 7.5 hour bus ride to Seattle. In one day I leave from Seattle and fly to Europe. The first leg of the journey is 9.5 hours, and lands in Copenhagen Denmark. From Copenhagen, it is a one hour flight to Berlin. Once in Europe I will be staying from August 18 till September 23 (five weeks). It's a pretty exciting trip... but I don't think it will really hit me until I'm actually there.
