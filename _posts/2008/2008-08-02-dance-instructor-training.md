I had aspirations of becoming a dance instructor for quite a while. During my Fall Quarter 2006 I had a friend who was taking a dance class at Eastern. I went with her and some other friends to the dance final and decided that I was hooked on dancing. The guy who teaches out at EWU also owns an excellent studio in Spokane ([Spokane Dance Company][1]). Since then I have taken ever dance class that I can, both at Eastern and at the studio. October 2007 I payed for and started participating in their Teacher Training Program. I took lots of classes and pasted a majority of my progress checks. between October and January. When classes started in the Winter my life got super hectic. I was working 30-40 hours a week at the CRC. I started doing my practicum that quarter too, working at the Juvenile about 30-60 hours a week. Furthermore I had a couple of classes I was taking. All in all, the studio took a second seat to everything I was doing.A couple of days ago, Glenn (the studio manager) asked me to meet with him. When I did, he told me that he had met with the studio’s board and they had decided that it was taking too long for me to make it though my progress checks. I was upset by this and relieved. It is nice to not feel guilty when I am unable to be at the studio. I also understand where they are coming from. I had used up all of the classes that I had payed for, and had been on a scholarship from the studio for a while. With just a few progress checks to go, I am no longer doing the instructor training program. I have no hurt feelings towards Glenn or the studio. I am grateful for the training that I have received and it was all a good experience. For all my friends at the studio, I hope to be able to come when I can. It might be a little while before I buy a new membership, because it’s been a while since I’ve had to have one. I don’t have any plans to purchase a new program from the studio anytime soon due to their costs and I paid for my teacher training in full already… which was fairly costly. But I hope to still see you all around.
