It might seem like I need to send my computer away, because I have been spending too much time on it. Currently my eyes and head hurt a bit, due to the fact that I have been spending hours and hours working on my computer. Currently I just finished wrapping my computer to be sent to HP Support, and writing a paper. I have had computer issues for the last several weeks. My wireless adapter is not working, something that will be vital in Europe. I thought at first it was a software issues (or drivers)... but after doing a complete system restore, this option was shown as not viable. Then I replaced the wireless adapter completely, but again no effect. This final step will probably do another complete system restore and either replace or re-image my mother board. Either way, I am currently stuck with a loaner computer from school and crossing my fingers that my computer will get back before I leave on my trip.
