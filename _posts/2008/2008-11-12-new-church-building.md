My church, [Victory Faith Fellowship][2], has been undergoing a lot of changes lately.

One huge leap of faith that we have made is in purchasing a new building. It has really been an amazing story of our church following after Gods dreams, which are bigger than anything that we could do ourself. It has really been a great ride so far. This Sunday, we will have our first meeting at [2024 N Argonne Rd][3].
