This weekend was the Fervent [Victory Faith][2]'s [college age group called Fervent][3] retreat. It was awesome. Unfortunately I did not get to go up for the entire event. I worked on Friday until about 1am. I got up there Saturday and it was pretty awesome. As Joe would say "I got saved."

It has been a long time since I've really felt connected with church or even some sort of community. The last couple of years, I've had a number of groups that I got to build relationship with, but this year it's been pretty dry. I have some friends that I hang out with at Eastern, but not nearly as much as when I lived on campus, or even last year when I hung out in Cheney quite a bit. I also haven't really been to the Spokane Dance Company since I stopped doing the instructor training program. I just really haven't hung out with people all that much the last couple of months. When I was in Europe, I met tons of people… but friends you make while traveling are way different then people you know more in-depth.

Needless to say, getting to hang out with a bunch of people at [Camp Tshimakain][4] was a very good thing. Joe's word regarding community (and building relationship last Fervent meeting for that matter) was powerful to me and what I needed to hear. God is so good that way, he always meets us right where we are.

Thank you for everybody I got to hang out with at the retreat, it was the first time I've really felt connected in quite a while. It's been really dry and you are all an encouragement to me. I appreciate all of you so much.

You can check out the [Fervent Retreat Album][5] from the retreat. Some great shots of the polar bear swimmers. I also uploaded some videos, [The Polar Bear Plunge][6] and [Around the World… Play and Record][7].
