Checking out my Google Analytics this morning, I realized that my website has been visited by people in every state this previous month. It's like I can travel around the country (really the world for that matter) every month. [My Analytics US Map Overlay][2] tells me that I've had visitors from 52 states. One of the extra is unspecified and the other is Washington DC. I thought thought that it was a pretty cool thought. Also, it's pretty cool that I got 1,412 visits this month. That number is pretty constant too. Someday I will probably upload monthly reports so other people can follow my traffic.
