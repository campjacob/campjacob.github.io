It seems like a lot of parts of my life are just like the blackberry bush picture, not quite ripe yet. I feel like I have had a lot of different things in my life that I have lost recently. For example the dance instructor training, the depth of my spirituality (i.e. I haven't been going to church as much as I think I should), some relationshipsâ€¦ etc. I feel like I've lost a lot recently. Other than having lost things, I'm also waiting for other things, especially my Europe trip, to know if I can do my practicum at the CRC, and just to see what my life is going to look like in the near future. I guess I have to agree with Tom Petty, and say that "The Waiting is the Hardest Part."
