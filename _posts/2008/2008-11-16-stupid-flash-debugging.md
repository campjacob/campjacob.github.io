I taught myself xHTML, CSS several years ago. Since then I have learned some PHP and JavaScript, VisualBasic, and C++. The newest thing that I have been working on is Fash. It's been really interesting, but I don't think I have a great grasp on action script and I can even fail at following a [Tutorial][1] on creating a gallery. I like to work though some things like this to take breaks from studying and other projects that I am working on. The final product was supposed to look like this [tutorial gallery][2]:

   [1]: http://www.flash-game-design.com/flash-tutorials/gallery-flash-tutorial.html
   [2]: /assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-example.swf

 
   `<iframe src="/assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-example.swf"></iframe>`
   - Code no longer works for embed
 
But mine (remember that some of it was quickly done... so isn't as pretty) [Flash Gallery Tutorial][1] did not work:

   [1]: /assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-try.swf

 
   `<iframe src="/assets/media/flash-gallery-tutorial-try.swf"></iframe>`
   - Code no longer works for embed
 
Anyways, I guess enough playing around with it today. I'll have to go back though and see where I messed up later, I need to work on my literature review for my research project.
