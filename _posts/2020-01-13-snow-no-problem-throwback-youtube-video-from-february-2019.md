Another short video created in [Quick](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275) and shot on my GoPro and my iPhone, where we adventure to a nearby park to play on the toys and in the snow. I filmed this back in February of 2019, but didn't end up uploading the video to YouTube or my website. The soundtrack is makers anthem.
