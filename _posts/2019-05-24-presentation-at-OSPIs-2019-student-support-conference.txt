The classrooms I get the opportunity to serve at the Pasco School District feels like a real privilege. I feel the work that I get to do is meaningful and really get to make an impact on the lives to staff and students. One of the reasons why it feels so meaningful to me is that fact that we try (while we don't always implement) to use best practices to address our students needs. 

Earlier this year, I got the opportunity to join the [Washington State Association of School Social Workers](http://www.wassw.org) and attend their annual conference. One of the presenters there from OSPI talked about the upcoming Student Support Conference and described that they would be making a request for proposals for conference presenters. I decided that I wanted to stretch myself some, although this is not the first conference that I have spoken at, and apply to present about our program and the best practices for classrooms serving students with emotional and behavioral disabilities.

The following is [the slides from my presentation](/assets/media/foundational-aspects-evidence-based-classrooms-presentation.pdf) (or [view on Notist](https://noti.st/campjacob/FhBMCJ)) and I figured that I would share it hear as well. You can see more information about the conference at [OSPI's Student Support Website](http://www.k12.wa.us/StudentSupport/default.aspx).

It's a little bit late tonight, but I will also say that while I didn't get the opportunity to stay for both days of the conference (I had some other stuff come up that I really had to do), the other presentations that I got to sit in on were great and it's good to see how much focus on both mental health and trauma there is for our students.
