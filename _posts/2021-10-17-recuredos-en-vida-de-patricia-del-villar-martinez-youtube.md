My concuñada (sister-in-law[^1]) passed away recently. They asked me to put together a remembrance video for her. I ended creating the photos with the various bible verses and quotes/information in Keynote and exporting them as images. Many of the images used are from Unsplash or from Wikipedia Commons. I used the SetApp app [PullTube](https://setapp.com/apps/pulltube) to download the songs from YouTube. Then I added everything to Final Cut, made some Ken Burns effects and transitions. The song list is as follows:

1. [Inolvidable Amor - Los Yonics](https://youtu.be/2EerWuUel4k) 4:05
2. [Rocío Dúrcal - Amor Eterno](https://youtu.be/A3gnFAiPKSs) 5:53
3. [Dos Coronas A Mi Madre - Cadetes De Linares 19 Éxitos](https://youtu.be/KLllnVjQwaM) 2:31
4. [BANDA MS - LA CASITA (LETRA)](https://youtu.be/2IyhHoW0Zt4) 3:37
5. [Para Mi Ángel En El Cielo](https://youtu.be/9AXm4-Yhueo) 3:04
6. [YO TE EXTRAÑARE - Tercer Cielo ( C.R )](https://youtu.be/43xQS1U3pLA) 4:27

[^1]: Concuñado/a is an interesting word in Spanish. We don't really have an English translation that is the same. Cunado/a is also Brother/Sister-in-law. But they are the one that is directly related to your spouse, where your Concuñado/a is their spouse. Familia connection is something that is often talked about in relation to Latinx culture, I find it telling that they would have more words to help express family relationships than we would in English.
