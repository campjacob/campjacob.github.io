I'm still figuring out how I want to share more personal things about my life. While I'm still currently on Facebook (and probably this post will be shared there), I almost never post there. I've actually turned off the notifications (other than for messenger). Sometimes I post to Instagram, but that seems somewhat rare as well. I probably most frequently post things to Snapchat, as I like that it just disapears, but I don't really have many friends there. 

Sometimes I share photos sometimes directly with people through the [Sharing Suggestions in Photos](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209035), but I'm still figuring it out. I have a couple hundred photos and video's I took while we were in the [Leavenworth area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leavenworth,_Washington) over Memorial Day. I wanted to share share something, so I put together this video using the [Quik App on my iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quik-gopro-video-editor/id694164275), which is such and easy way to put together a pretty neat looking video quickly. 

You can also also see some some of the photos from our trip.

We got the opportunity to stay in Jack's Cabin, through airbnb which was a phenomenal experience. The video take you on a bit of tour, but there is really nothing like being able to walk out the back door and have a river and and little waterfall right outside.
