With the quarantine and everything going on, it seemed like a good idea to do a fun activity and get our mind off of everything for a while. 

We made a stop motion video by taking photos with my GoPro and processing them through [Stop Motion Pro App](https://www.cateater.com). It was pretty easy to do and fun to go through and plan, set up, and implement. The final product turned out great as well.

The music is included in the app and called Mister Exposition.

We also built a fort in the back yard. It was fun to put together. You can see a time lapse video and some photos.
