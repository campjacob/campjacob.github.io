The following is an infographic that I created based on Barron, Montuori, and Barron's 1997 book Creators on Creating: Awakening and Cultivating the Imaginative Mind. Its a pretty interesting book. They took 39 creative people talking about their creative processes. You can by the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Creators-Creating-Cultivating-Imaginative-Consciousness/dp/0874778549/). You can download a [PDF Version of the Infographic - Creators on Creating](/assets/media/creators-on-creating-infographic.pdf). I made all of the graphics using Keynote, it's amazing how powerful it is, then I exported the slides as images and combined them into a single PDF / jpeg. You can download the [Keynote Version of Creators on Creating](/assets/media/creators-on-creating-infographic.key) as well.
