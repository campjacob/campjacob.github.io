On Saturday, I got the opportunity to attend [My Friends Place's][2] Fundraiser called the Lawyer's and Artist's Ball 2011. It was a pretty amazing event. I have been lucky to be able to be on the committee to start My Friends Place (you can also check out the [My Friends Place Cause Page][3]. My Friends Place is both a non-profit organization and a program of [Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery][4]. It has been quite a process and I have been loving the opportunity to be a part of something big and a great need for our community!The event went wonderfully. There were tons of great costumes and I think we raised a lot of money. You can check out the photos I took (I wish I had taken more) in my [Facebook Album Lawyer's & Artist's Ball 2011 Album][5]. It was impacting to hear the story one man told about his son who recently died... but had previously been homeless. We found out that he and his family had donated $10,000.00, which is enough to open the doors as soon as possible.
