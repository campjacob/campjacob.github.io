Life has been busy lately, and I haven't posted anything for a while. Most of my time has been taken up by working. I'm working as a Mental Health Case Manager at Nueva Esperanza a part of [Tri-Cities Community Health][1]. I have been really loving it. I've gotten lots of cool opportunities working there, and am learning a lot.

I've still been working at [Safe Harbor][2]. Next month, I will be starting to lead a group for pre-teens / teens. I'm pretty excited about it.

I also got to go to the social night out for [Young Professionals of the Tri-Cities][3]. It was nice to meet so many people of different organizations. I really enjoyed it.

I'm hoping to have some changes come to my website here in the near future.
