I've been a bit behind on posting. I have another episode that I still need to edit and then I'm recording another one today with my mom. So expect me to be posting a couple in the next week or two. This episode was really good, but it is hard to talk about my dad and his history.

<i class="fas fa-microphone-alt"></i> Episode #7

> Jacob and Judy use the OSHO Zen Tarot Deck and pull the major arcana card, II Inner Voice. We talked about listening to our inner voices and how that can look. Judy shares some experiences hearing/following that voice and other times that she did not recognize it. We also spent time talking about the story of Judy and my Dad meeting, starting their relationship, and what led up to the murders he committed.
