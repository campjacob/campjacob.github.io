A while ago, I was doing quite a few poster designs for [Natural Selection CrossFit][1] ([Facebook][2]). I do really doing graphic design projects, although lately I feel I have been too busy to do much of it. This project took almost 20 hours to put together, and went through a number of iterations. When I was first talking to the client, they described wanting something **Superbowlish** because the event will be taking place on Superbowl Sunday, (you can [sign up to participate][3]). The following are the first three design concepts I had. I wasn't really too happy with any of them, and these are just quick mock ups and not final versions.

I'm assuming a part of it is because I'm really not much of a football fan. ][4] When I was originally asked to come up with a poster design, this is what I had in my head.

I threw it together and offered it as an option, after looking at a lot of Super Bowl posters with the idea that I could come back and improve the overall feel of this concept. ][6] This is the third version I created.

After going through putting these concept together, they had come up with a different design concept, one which I really liked and think turned out pretty awesome. Retro looking posters are pretty cool, and they talked about wanting to have a design like the old school Pee Chee's. You can see the 11x16 and the 8.5x11 versions of the posters. I even made a cover image to go along with their Facebook page.

All in all it was a fun project.  I'd love to know what you guy's think about the designs.  I'm pretty satisfied with the final version.
