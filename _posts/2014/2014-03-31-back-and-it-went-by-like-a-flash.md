I'm back at home now. The rest of my trip was fun, and went by very quickly. My last day in San Francisco was a little obscured by rain. I went back for one more trip to the expo hall and made my way around all of the smaller iOS and OSX Developers. I signed up to try to win a [ScanSnap Scanner][2] (they are really amazing, and I'm planning on buying one at some point). If I had money, I would have also bought a [File Transporter][3] because there was a great discount and I've been wanting one for a long time. There was a ton of other stuff that was very interesting, and I could see myself using and purchasing in the future. I got to sign up for the public beta for [BusyMac new contact management software][4] which will be released soon.

I walked around the Financial District for a while and went to the Apple Store (I've actually never been to a real apple store. It was cool, but I was much more blown away by the Macworld Event. I went to bed early that night, because I had to get up at 3:45 AM to be able to catch my 7 am flight. I arrived at Sea Tac Airport and started making my way back to the Tri-Cities to see my Family. You can see the following video's that I uploaded to YouTube of Mateo playing with the Slow Motion controls on my iPhone 5s. It makes me laugh :). I hope you enjoy it.

Make sure to check out my album, [Macworld / iWorld 2014][5]. on Facebook, as I've uploaded the rest of my photos from the trip.
