Mateo has been growing super fast over the last year. I put together a video showing his growth over the last year in [iPhoto][1]. I looked at a bunch of different ways of trying to put this video together. I started in [iMovie][2], but it lacked control. I looked at [Adobe Premier][3] but it is too complicated. I even started to make a [Keynote Presentation][4] with plans to make to export it as a movie. After starting, I decided that it would take way too long to individually animate each photo, and it would lack a consistent variance. I decided finally to go with iPhoto and make a slide show. It puts movies together quickly. While it still lacks the control that I would like, I think that it turned out well.
