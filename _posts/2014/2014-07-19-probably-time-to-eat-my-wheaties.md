Well, it's almost two as I am decided to get up because I couldn't shut my mind off, so I decided to get up and write. Just one of those nights when you just can't unwind and fall comfortably into a deep and restful sleep. Currently we are in [Puyallup][3] and getting ready to go to Orlando Florida for [CADCA][4]'s 2014 [Mid Year Conference][5]. I'm super excited, although somewhat worried about how [Mateo][6] will do on on the red eye flight tomorrow night. Here's hoping that he sleeps.

As I sit here thinking about how I can't sleep, I'm reminded of the Wheaties commercials from the 80's and 90's:

I feel like maybe I haven't been eating enough of my Wheaties lately, if by Wheaties I mean not overwhelming myself with having too much on my plate, keeping everything organized (generally in a [GTD][7] fashion). It feels like I just have so many things that I have coming up this fall and things that I need to get ready for.

With [changing jobs to the Pasco School District][8], I have a [PRAXIS II][9] exam that I need to start studying for, along with a training and just getting ready to change positions. Along with that, I am still trying to manage my current clients, follow up with all of them before I transition and determine if they will be transferred to a therapist, to whoever gets hired as a new case manager, or if they just need to be closed.

More than the PRAXIS II, I'm also going to be eligible to take my test for my [clinical social work][10] license this fall. While these tests and changes are in the back of my mind, they are not anything that has priority right now. My focus the last couple of weeks has been the two new classes I'm going to be teaching at [Heritage][11] this fall. I taught case management last Fall, but it was an online course. I decided that it would be a better format to have it be an in class format, which means I'm having to go through and revamp the course completely. I am really excited about it, and have really enjoyed my time teaching in the past, it's just a lot of work.

Going to Florida for a week is going to be a lot of fun with some great learning experiences, but also feels like a lot in the midst of everything. You can rest assured that I will be writing up some posts about my time there and the conference. I might even be able to get around to the book that I brought with me to read, but we will have to see about that one. I can say one thing for sure, when I get back, I'm going to have to buckle down and eat my Wheaties.
