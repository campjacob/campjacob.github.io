It's been a while since I've posted any family stuff on here, so I figured I needed to put together some recent throwbacks. The last couple of weeks I've had my head down and working on my business. I've been doing more side graphic, logo, website, and other design services. I made a website for my mom's d≈çTERRA business ([Judy Dirks, A Guide to Living Well][2]). It's super beautiful and uses a parallax design on the header images and turned out pretty amazing. I made it in [Squarespace][3], and am pretty proud of my work.

I've also put together a website and new logo for my business. I spent a couple of months trying to come up with a name that I felt really worked and wanted. [The Design Clinic][6] was the name that I ultimately came up with.

While, I know that Easter is quite a while ago, but I put together a short little video of Mateo doing his Easter Egg Hunt. He is super cute, you can view it on YouTube ([Fishies & Eggs -- Easter 2014][7]).

I also put uploaded a new album of photos from Mateo's visit at his Grandpas farm in Benton City. His first time riding a horse, there were some pretty cute photos. You can find it on the Facebook Album, [Grandpa Lives on a Farm][8].
