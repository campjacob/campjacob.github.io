![ I'm GOING! ][1]{: .align-left} I'm GOING!

I've been itching to travel again, as it's been a really long time since I've gone any considerable distances (since I came back from my [J][2][aunt Down to South America][2]). In two weeks, I'll be heading down to [San Francisco][3] for the [Macworld / iWorld event][4]. It's a trade show and conference. This year, I can only really afford to do the expo hall, but hopefully in future years I might be able to attend the actual conference portion. Minnie has been calling it my nerd conference. I guess I have a lot more nerdery that I partake in, then I share here. Minnie's always reminding me about it. When I'm driving, and want to listen to [my podcasts][5], she calls them my  nerd casts. She makes fun of me because after she goes to bed, I've been watching my nerd show. Netflix is amazing. I've never watched [Star Trek Next Generation][6], and I've always been much more of the original [Star Wars][7] Fan. I'm enjoying it.

With all of those great nerd activities, it makes sense for me to be going to a nerd conference. I'm sure that I will be posting more as I go along.
