![ SOA style Happy Birthday Graphic for Minnie ][1] SOA style Happy Birthday Graphic for Minnie 

   [1]: /assets/media/happy-birthday-old-lady-sons-anarchy-graphic.jpg

Not going to be a long post, just a quick graphic I put together for Minnie's Birthday. She really likes [Sons of Anarchy][2], so I figured that theme would be fun (even if it is a day late). I found the picture on [Northwest Harley Blog][3] and used the magic healing brush to erase the writing. I used the [Carnevalee Freak Font][4] to try to match the Son's of Anarchy Font with applied shadow and stroke. The [SOA Logo][5] was taken from one of lots on the internet with the background deleted and a circular shape with opacity placed behind it to help it stand out (and some other blending options). If you're interested, you can download the [photoshop file][6].
