One of my favorite podcasts to listen to every week is the [Mac Power Users][2]. I can give credit to their show for the majority of the productivity and ability to best make use of my mac from their show. If you're a apple products user, I'd highly recommend their show, it's pretty amazing. I've sent a couple of emails to the hosts over and have listened to so many of their episodes, I feel like I almost know them.  A couple of weeks ago, I responded to a call to talk about how users use [TextExpander][3].  I have been heavily using TextExpander both at home and at work.  Looking at my statistics this morning, over the last couple of months, I've saved almost 17 hours of typing time.  When I was listening to their show on Monday, riding my bike home, I was surprised and excited to hear them share from my email on the program.  I am very sure it was about me, but they said the listener's name was Jared, not Jacob.  It's OK, it still made me feel super famous!

The episode is about [GarageBand][4].  It is a pretty cool product.  I've played around with it some, but I'm hoping to dive a little more into it after listening to [the episode][5]. They also talked about Macworld iWorld 2014.  I'm actually hoping to be able to go.  You should listen to the episode, it was really great.
