I got off work tonight, and was hungry. I don’t have any food in my house, and am in desperate need of going grocery shopping. For some reason, this didn’t sound like a good idea at almost midnight when I got home. I decided to order pizza. Looking up [dominoes][2] online, I found their order process super easy and kind of cool. I just had to enter information, and it placed my order. The confirmation page (see below) told me who began baking my pizza and when, and the same for putting it in the oven, boxing it up, and leaving for delivery. That’s pretty sweet. Probably more information than I need to know, but still very cool to know.
