Several years ago, I started going out for walks every night. It has been good to me. When I first started losing weight several years ago, I think that starting to have an exercise regiment (while it is not very hardcore) was what really started it. While I have plateaued in the last six months and started gaining some of my weight back, having that simple daily exercise has been good for my body. For my weight I probably need to start working more on my diet and changing my eating habits to move to the next level. Over the last year I have averaged over 10,000 steps, 38 minutes of exercise (normally it is walking, but sometimes my own form of yoga, swimming, hiking badger, and if you follow my snapchat often my bike).

Getting out and walking has been good for my mental health as well. There are some days that I just can't leave and walk, and those days I feel like I'm going to go a bit crazy. With my crazy schedule and doing more things than I probably should (between my two jobs, family, and social life), being able to go out for walks seem like less of a nice thing and more of something mandatory.

As I've written about many time on here, I am an avid listener to podcasts (by the way, anybody want to make a podcast with me... I'd love to be a creator of one someday as well). I listen to some music, but I spend most of my listening time listening to a number of great podcasts. I decided that I needed to also have some input into my brain that is just fun as well. In my life, I find if I can box things around something I already do I can get really good at doing it. Basically, if I can find something that I already do regularly and just add a little bit or do something a little bit different to that... I find that I am much more able to keep those changes going in my life. Building on something that we are already doing can really make making changes in our lives much easier.

So about a year or year and a half ago, I started listening to audio books as I walk. I pretty quickly went through all of the [Game of Thrones books](http://www.georgerrmartin.com) (they are great... and I'm still excited to get HBO at some point and make it through [the TV seres](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones) as well). I listen to [Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard](http://rickriordan.com/series/magnus-chase-and-the-gods-of-asgard/) series, another one that I would highly recommend for a good read / listen.

As you can see, my interests tend to be pretty focused on being able to be taken to some sort of fantasy world. I'm a big fan of both Fantasy and Science Fiction genres. My latest series I've just made it through is the [Red Queen Series by Victoria Averard](https://www.victoriaaveyard.com/red-queen-series).  It's another great selection to listen to. It is around a world divided by red and silver blood types and people with superhuman powers. But as always, it is more about the people that you learn to love and hate in the book and the stories that get told.

In particular, one of the things that I especially enjoy about the Fantasy and Science Fiction generes is that they can step outside of our lives and make a case for some larger societal norms and how we treat each other. Anyways, I did really enjoy the Red Queen Series.
