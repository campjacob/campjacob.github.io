I absolutely love doing anything outdoors, and one of my favorite things I do every year (hopefully a couple of times this year), is being able to get some people I care about and getting out on the river and just floating. It's slow, but to me it is so relaxing and a beautiful experience (even if we don't get out of the water until it late in the evening.

You can see this on my website, [Floating the River - Summer Fun](https://jacobrcampbell.com/2019/07/floating-the-river-summer-fun) or on the [GoPro Sharing Service - Floating the River](https://gopro.com/v/7a9DrBpVRJkg6).
