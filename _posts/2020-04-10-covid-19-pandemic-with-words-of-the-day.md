In needing a bit of break from more strenuous academic writing, I wanted to do a bit of creative writing activity. I have taken the 27 most recent words of the day from the [Look Up](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448). Look Up is an app on iOS and Mac. At least each new sentence has one of the words from the last almost month. Also, note that I took these words in order and have kept them that way. I hope that some of this makes you **guffaw**. 

In these perilous times, during this pandemic, I want to **repudiate** Donald Trump for how he and some others are managing the crisis. COVID-19 has hit us like a **tempest** and it is effecting everyone around the world. Trump tends to **bloviate** frequently, and I can't watch the daily briefings anymore. Even when he has outright lied, he pretends to be **unerring**. 

If you aren't already practicing social distancing, you need to make a **cessation** of going out and being around people as much as possible.  I know the days are beautiful, perhaps with a **zephyr**. To flatten the curve and make it through this, we all need to be **percipient**. These actions do require an **exaction**, but it is worth it. The price is the only way that we can **rescind** all of the potential future pain. By making large and small sacrifices together, we will overcome by **accretition** positive decision by positive decision. I encourage you recognize the hard road ahead, and in the face of the dangers be phlegmatic but with our loved ones don't be afraid to share your feelings.

This post might find you, eating your **repast** alone, but know that we are in this together. It is time for a generation of **stentor**s to rise up and speak to power and support each other. Our world is in a **precarious** place. I don't think I can wax **panegyric** enough to all of the health care heroes. If I could **daub** all of you a thick coat of my care and appreciation, I would. You go and save lives and watch as people die as you put yourself in **quotidian** dangers. Many of you work until you are **ruddy** in the face. You will keep working until we get this crisis to a place of **stasis**. 

When we are through with this crisis, we will come back to a place of **concinnity**. People will go back to putting **ovoid** shapes in dogs' mouths on Tic Tok. I will continue working to become **erudite** as I study for my Ph.D. I'm sure there will still be **fractious** political difficulties. But my **evocative** wish is that we can come together. We don't have to frolic together in the **spume** like a corny love story. But... we should be able to agree that we are all in this world together, and just like we all need  **potable** water, we need to be support each other.

When that happens, just like the **pangram** says, I will 'pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs,' so I can continue my **jaunt** to find a better world.
