[Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery][1] is putting on an event, [My Friends Place Presents:  Will Work For Food.][2]  I'm really excited.  I started wanting to put on this event several months ago.  I remember thinking about how much of a need in the community there is, but how few kids are actually coming to MFP to stay.  With about 1,500 teens in the Tri-Cities have been homeless at some point in their lives, according to national statistics... I can't imagine any reasons why we should ever be empty. It's gonna be a really amazing event. We are having four DJ's coming and doing their show.

This design project was created for [My Friends Place][3]'s Event, [Will Rage for Food][4].  I made it in [Adobe Photoshop][5].  I got some of the images through a Google Image Search.  I took the [DJ Mixer][6] and [the Girl][7], but I made everything else. The following are the images associated with this event
