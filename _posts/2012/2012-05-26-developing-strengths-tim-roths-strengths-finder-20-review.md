I'm currently helping out at my agency, [Nueva Esperanza Community Counseling Services][2], with a working group redesigning out treatment plan that we use with our client.  It's been a good process and I think something important to consider.  In participating in this process, I have been thinking about how we develop strengths.  I decided that since I was thinking about strengths perspective, I should put up some information in my [resources section][3].

I also recently finished reading a copy of Tom Roth's Strengths Finder 2.0 (make sure to check out all of my other [book reviews][4]).  I'd recommend the book, but I will acknowledge that it takes some homework time to really gain any significance from it.

To really get the most out of Strengths Finder 2.0, you must purchase a new copy of the book (or a book that has an unused access code for their website).  The book really is only supplemental, and I felt like it was almost like a sales pitch for their web program to examine individuals strengths.  The majority of the learning I accomplished seemed to come from using their [Clifton Strengths Finder][5].   This is basically an assessment that attempts to help you discover what strengths and assets you have have though choosing answers on a web based form.

I did find the results to be valuable, and informative.  I also really appreciated hearing about a strengths perspective from a different source (i.e. not just about mental health, but seeing the value in the business / personal life).  It's been an interesting couple of months reading (don't worry, it didn't take me a couple of months to finish this book, as it's quite small).  I've also been reading Plato's The Republic.  While I haven't finished, I hope to within the next couple of weeks, so you can look forward to a review of that book too.  But to give you a small look forward, I've been amazed how many theories and modern ideas are espoused in Plato's work, including strengths perspective.
