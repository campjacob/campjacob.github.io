Recently at work, I created a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for a training I did during one of our staff meetings. It is about affecting environmental change and empowerment theory. You can check out the tag Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering Presentation for all of the material that I uploaded regarding this presentation. It was really fun to put together, especially due to the fact that I used the theme of [Pinky and the Brain][1]. During my presentation, I even featured the cartoon introduction copied off of YouTube. You can see it below and linked at [Pinky and The Brain Intro][2] on YouTube. I created my own background title slide using some coloring page's I found online (I lost the links to them).
