As promised, we did go to [Prague][1] (or [in Czech "Praha"][2]). It took 6 and a half hours to travel there by bus. We spent the morning wondering around the bus depot. Upon arriving in Prague, we figured out where we were fairly quickly. But we ended up wondering around in the rain until about 1:30 in the morning. We also talked to three different hostels. Our 16 person dorm room in the [Hostel Marabou][3] is pretty nice.
