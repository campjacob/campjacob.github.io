It feels like Spring is finally hear. We went to the Duck Pond at Columbia Park and fed the Ducks.

I will say, after I was posting about buying bread to feed the ducks, a friend reached out to me and told me about the problems related to that, so you should consider feeding them something else. Fun video though.
