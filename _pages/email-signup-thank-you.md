excerpt: "I really appreciate you signing up for my mailing list. I'm still figuring out a bit of what exactly it is going to be, where I am going in the future. Here is to us figuring out the future together! You can also read the previous emails that I have sent out."

I do really think of this as a journey we are going on together. I'm glad that you are taking that journey with me. I'm still not exactly sure how I'm going to use this email newsletter. One thing that you can trust is that I won't be selling or giving away your information. There will always be an unsubscribe option if you no longer are interested in hearing about some of the things that I'm interested in. I hope that it will be a bit eclectic, kind of like me. 

If you are looking for something to read, you can read some of my [latest blog posts](/blog/), check out my [academic resources](/resources/), or see the [archive of emails](/communications/) that I've sent out so far.
