Research methods is a difficult subject for a number of students and practitioners. It can be scary to dive into for some, and it's topics can be challenging. My post, [Research Methods & Evidence Based Practice](/resources/research-methods-evidence-based-practice), gives a good overview of research and many of the article included. The following would a list of the various resources that pertain to research methods.

{% assign informationals = site.resources | where: "categories", "Informational" %}

{% assign research-methods-informationals = informationals | where: "tags", "Research Methods" %}
{% for resource in research-methods-informationals %}
- [{{ resource.title }}]({{ resource.url }})
{% endfor %}
