    excerpt: "All of our lives are a series of brief snapshots jumbled yet fitting together like pieces of a puzzle. Have you ever had one of those moments with a friend, where you see them say or do something, and it show's you who they are? Or looked at a picture, that spoke volumes? [My Blog](/blog/) is meant to be a window into just who Jacob really is, giving those out there a few snapshots."

    excerpt: "I believe that developing community and relationships is important.  One reason that I decided to create my website, other then the geeky fun of it, is I believe it gives me a better way to be able to connect with people.  I've posted some resources that are about me [professionally](/professional-connections/), personally, and other such information.  Feel free to [contact me](/contact/)."
