    excerpt: "All of our lives are a series of brief snapshots jumbled yet fitting together like pieces of a puzzle. Have you ever had one of those moments with a friend, where you see them say or do something, and it show's you who they are? Or looked at a picture, that spoke volumes? My Blog is meant to be a window into just who Jacob really is, giving those out there a few snapshots."
