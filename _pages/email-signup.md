Posted originally in 2019... I'm still figuring this out. I sign up my students for class specific lists and hope to eventually create a monthly email sharing information with contacts I have. But I am for now deleting this sign up form, as there is some actor creating new accounts that seem to be fake even though I am not sending out any newsletters. I am going to for now, just stick with class specific email lists.
