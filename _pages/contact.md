Hi, My name is Jacob Rodman Campbell V.S.P. (the V.S.P. is on my birth certificate and stands for "Very Special Person"). I'm a lot of things, the least of which is a web / graphic designer (it's really just a hobby for me). I have a couple of jobs and am super involved in a lot of things. You can check out my [CV](/cv/) (kine of like a resume). I really am an advocate for people in need (especially at risk youth, you can check out [my story because I was one][2]).

I can sometimes be bad at responding to people via email, message me at on Twitter [@campjacob](https://twitter.com/campjacob) to connect with me. But if you really would like to send me an email, I do enjoy reading them. 

Your you can send mail to my physical address (although I'm bad at going to post office and actually picking it up):

PO Box 185   
Pasco, WA 99301
