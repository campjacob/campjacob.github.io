Hi, My name is Jacob Rodman Campbell V.S.P. (the V.S.P. is on my birth certificate and stands for "Very Special Person"). I'm a lot of things, the least of which is a web / graphic designer (it's really just a hobby for me). I have a couple of jobs and am super involved in a lot of things. You can check out my [CV](/cv/) (kind of like a resume). I really am an advocate for people in need (especially at risk youth, you can check out [my story because I was one](/testimony/)).

I can sometimes be bad at responding to people via email, message me at on Twitter [@campjacob](https://twitter.com/campjacob) to connect with me. But if you really would like to send me an email, I do enjoy reading them.
