Along with the other [things I do](/cv), I run a business named the Locus of Transformation. You can read about when I originally came up with the name, [Now Open, New Small Business Owner](/blog/2013/11/now-open-new-small-business-owner). I still own the domain and idea of [the Design Clinic](https://thedesignclinic.org), but I really doubt I'm going to be looking to do graphic design work anytime soon, but I like it being there for prosperity sake. 

Currently, I do supervision for persons looking to obtain their LICSW. I've done some consulting and speaking too. You can contact me if you have something you'd like to partner with me about. I also purchase the domain `transformation.support`, which I love and plan to use as the home for these endeavors.
