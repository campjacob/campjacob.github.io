This project is just a little bit of fun for me. There are [{{ site.dictionary | size }} definitions](/dictionary/) in the project. Most definitions were taken from [**Te**rminology app](https://agiletortoise.com/terminology/), which is based on the Princeton University's [WordNet lexical database](https://wordnet.princeton.edu). You can use the tools below to filter and sort all of the entries.
