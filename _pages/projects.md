I have various small projects I have created. These are sometimes different ways of showcasing information I create or am engaging with with. The following is a list of some of these projects.


- [Now](https://vsp.ink/now), a page I update with my weekly schedule and daily schedule to assist my students and colleagues in knowing when my office hours are and when they can best engage with me.
- [Presentations](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), a showcase of the the various presentations I give for all my classes and and speaking engagements.
- [New words Project](/dictionary/), a set entries where I add new words that I come across and share about the words and some of sources I'm reading. 
- [Communications](/communications/), where I host and keep track of all of the mailing list emails that I send.
- I'd like the idea of having things that I share be on my website, I was tinkering with and will like to go back to including any of my external posts in my [microposts](/microposts) section.
- I do some consultation, licensure supervision using the business identify of [Locus of Transformation](/transformation-support/).
- I used to do some [graphic and website design](/design/), you can see [the website](https://thedesignclinic.org) from this as well.
