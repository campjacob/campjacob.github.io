My Master's Degree Terminal Project was an in-depth program evaluation. There are a number of resources related to it, if you are interested in seeing how a program evaluation can be put together. The [Overview of The Crisis Residential Centerâ€™s Directions Program Evaluation: For the 2006-2008 Financial Grant Years Study](/resources/overview-of-the-crisis-residential-centers-directions-program-evaluation) is a good place to start and includes a great broad perspective of the entire project. You can also see a list of all of the articles and informational resources below:

{% assign directions-program-informationals = informationals | where: "tags", "Directions Program Evaluation" %}
{% for resource in directions-program-informationals %}
- [{{ resource.title }}]({{ resource.url }})
{% endfor %}

As well, you can see the actual final articles about the program evaluation as well.

{% assign directions-program-articles = articles | where: "tags", "Directions Program Evaluation" %}
{% for resource in directions-program-articles %}
- [{{ resource.title }}]({{ resource.url }})
{% endfor %}
