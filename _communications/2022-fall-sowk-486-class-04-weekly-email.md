I'm looking forward to seeing all of you on Wednesday!  

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week four is a continuation of laying the groundwork for this course. It is focused on providing an overview of the helping process. The Hepworth et al. (2022) text formats the helping process into three phases. 

- Phase 1: Exploration, Engagement, Assessment, and Planning
- Phase II: Implementation and Goal Attainment
- Phase III: Evaluation and Termination

During the session, we will be examining an overview of considerations we should have in each of the phases. We will also be looking at how we set the environment with our clients and what the interviewing process looks like. Finally, we will spend some time discussing some potential ethical dilemmas. The agenda is:

- Overview of the three phases of the helping process
- Setting the environment
- Interviewing clients
- Practice with ethical dilemmas

## Unit Assignments

Attend class and complete the reading quiz

## Unit Resources

In talking about rapport and connection with clients, we review [Leach (2015)](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=e53121a7-3121-4af1-ad5d-6f3f06e1a5fe) to understand some of the strategies and behaviors that improve client trust.
