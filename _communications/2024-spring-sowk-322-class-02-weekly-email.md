I hope you are all enjoying the start of the semester. The following is the plan for [week 02](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-02_122_-_128.jnz) of SOWK 322.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Things are getting started for SOWK 322. This week's readings are around a historical perspective of advocacy and creating change for persons who experience disabilities. I've made the assignments for who is doing which group, and you will get an opportunity to connect with your group members. The following are your learning objectives this week:

- Identify historical perspectives on disability
- Describe general changes in policy over the past 300 years
- Prepare for group presentations

## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Read Chapter 2 in the Rothman (2018) text.
- Watch [Working with Vulnerable Populations, a Rationale for Social Work Policy Practice](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/01/working-vulnerable-populations-rationale-social-work-policy-practice/)
- Watch [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 - Week 02](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2f17fcd2-db63-4de5-b08d-b0fd0178f953)

**Assignment 01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

For week two, you will need to make at least three replies across the forums. There are two that are focused on the reading for this week. You need to make at least one reply in each of their forums:

- [Chapter 2 Discussion Prompts](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-02_122_-_128.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=060b8865-e10b-49f5-b346-355814ec88db) offers four different ideas to help write and connect your thoughts about the textbook. Choose one of these, or if you have another topic or aspect you want to address feel free to put it in this forum. You engage in dialog with your peers about their responses. Please include at least two replies in this section.
- [History of Persons with Disabilities](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-02_122_-_128.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=e75d4545-ddb7-4ecf-8d0f-c7b8759005d7) explains that there are four general periods of history that your textbook groups together in considering persons with disabilities. Students should choose at least one period of history and there is a list of aspects of that period that students can write about.

There are also forums for the Disability Population Group Presentation. I have put everybody into groups, see [Group Assignments for Assignment 03](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=01068d49-2c41-4d9e-b037-7268b8aff21d).

Students may make a reply and ask questions in [Questions about Assignment 02: Disability Population Group Presentation](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-02_122_-_128.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=f5261eb0-63cc-4d8e-99dd-93433283c64d), but you are not required to. Students do need to make at least one reply and connect with their group. Group information is as follows:

- Students also need to make at least one reply their groups forum.
