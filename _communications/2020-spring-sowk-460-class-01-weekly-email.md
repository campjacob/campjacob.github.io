It was great to see all of you on Monday. I do plan on continuing with the weekly emails for this semester. There is a couple of things that might be helpful for you. First off, if you haven't already downloaded the syllabus from My Heritage, you can also download it here ([Spring 2020 SOWK 460 Syllabus](/assets/media/spring-2020-sowk-460-syllabus.pdf)). I'll be working on posting the reading quizzes this weekend so if you want to get an early start you can. 

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
