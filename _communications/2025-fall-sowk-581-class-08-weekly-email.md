## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week eight is a synchronous week, with class on 10/18. Students read about the implementation of relational theory from Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022). There are forums reflecting on the week's reading, considering self-disclosure, transference, and countertransference. During class, we are tentatively discussing:

- The third space and relational theory in general
- Self-disclosure 
- Teaching mindfulness

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Cooper and Granucci Lesser's (2022) Chapter 7 _Relational Theory_

**W-08 A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are three forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- The [chapter seven reflections questions] () forum explores the readings and you to consider identity, developmental models, understanding a third space, and how this might be applied to a group.
- The forum [self-disclosure] () gives a space to talk about intersubjectivity and self-disclosure.
- [Transference and countertransference] () to be able to talk about the impact this has on our therapeutic relationships.

I can't post in the forums currently, so here is the forum content:

**Chapter 07 Reflection Questions**

Chapter seven focuses on relational theory. Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) provide a set of potential reflection questions at the end of each chapter. Use this forum to respond to any prompts in chapter seven.

> 1. Discuss how the Black identity development model and the White identity development model affected the therapeutic relationship in the case of Carol.
> 2. Consider how these models might be helpful in your own work with a client. Refer to other identity development models that may also be appropriate.
> 3. How did the therapist and Carol create a third space? Apply the concept of the third space to your own work with a client.
> 4. Discuss the use of relational cultural theory with the new connections group. Carefully consider the role of the therapist and the theoretical basis for her interventions.
> 5. Consider how you might work with the new connections group if you were using a different theoretical framework (see Chapter 6). (p. 132)

**Self-Disclosure**

Cooper and Grnucci Lesser (2022) discuss the topic of intersubjectivity and self-disclosure, describing that a relational approach to psychotherapy is focused on genuine connection and safety and requires mutually engaging, fluidity, and honesty. There are many ways to provide this authenticity. Clients often want to know about us as well. In this forum, I'm interested in:

- What are some ways that we can provide authenticity without personal self-disclosure
- What are some of the thoughts you have about personal self-disclosure
- What are some of the types of questions you've been asked in your practicum placement requesting self-disclosure, and how did you handle that

**Transference and Countertransference**

Transference and countertransference are brought up in the discussion of the therapeutic relationship (Cooper & Grnucci Lesser, 2022). In this forum, I'd like to have students discuss any of the following prompts:

- Define transference and countertransference
- How do transference and countertransference shape the therapeutic relationship? 
- Discuss strategies clinicians can use to manage these dynamics effectively.
- Transference and countertransference are common in clinical practice. However, if not addressed, they can create ethical challenges. What potential ethical issues could arise from unmanaged transference or countertransference?
- How can therapists maintain professionalism in these situations?

**A-03 Chapter Reading Quizzes**

I'm going to make [W-08 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 07](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=19d5c169-1154-46f7-9e56-9ef4c7f092d7) worth extra credit this week (e.g., you can either choose to engage in it or not without it counting against you). If you do plan to do it, it is still due the same day/time at Saturday 10/18, 8:00 AM.

**Midterm Evaluation**

Please complete the [SOWK 581 Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=8FE81FF0-BA23-4813-A04B-13DE6C06DE83&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=H0MLKWB330). I would love to hear feedback about how this class is going and what I can do to improve your experience.

## Unit Resources

I'm still working on my `Slides` for this week. I'll add them closer to the class session and will add any additional handouts.

The [Lecture Videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Lecture_Videos.jnz) tab in the MyHeritage course is where you will be able to find class recordings.
