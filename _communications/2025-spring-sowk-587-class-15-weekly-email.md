## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 15 is asynchronous. The reading provides many case studies, and students can consider examples of social work practice.

Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate the ability to critically reflect on strategies, challenges, and interventions used in practice
- Apply course concepts to real-world scenarios by sharing and analyzing case examples

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Jarolmen and Bautista-Thomas (2023) Chapter 11 _Studies, Analysis, and Discussion from an Authentic School Practice Perspective_

We will be considering practice examples in school social work this week. You can find what group you are in the [A-02 Group Assignments and Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9ac60a9e-af93-4ffa-a1b8-df0b7f662696) handout. Students must submit at least **two replies** this week in their group's forum by Monday at 8 AM. We agreed for increased equity in student work expectations that there would be just discussion with no required synthesis. In this week's forum, students are expected to engage with textbook content by reflecting on case studies, responding to practice vignettes, and answering discussion questions. They are opportunities to should share personal examples from their practicum, analyze textbook cases using reflection prompts, and respond to structured discussion questions demonstrating their understanding of social work strategies, challenges, and interventions.
