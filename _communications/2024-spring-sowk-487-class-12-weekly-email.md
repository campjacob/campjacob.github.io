Remember, we do not have in-person classes this week.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 12 is focused on group work and using technology to create groups. Cabiati (2021) provides the example of an online support group using social workers as the participants. Barak et al. (2008) provide some context for enhancing empowerment for online support groups. Finally, students have two forums to respond to that ask them to discuss their planned use of technology in their practice.
