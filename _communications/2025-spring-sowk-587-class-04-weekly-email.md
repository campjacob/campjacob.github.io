I hope you are all having a great week. My lecture video is longer then I tend to try to do, but I think it provides a lot of good information about special education law and the implementation in a school setting.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Social workers frequently are placed in settings serving students with disabilities and need to understand and interface with special educational services. Having specific knowledge regarding special education law, how services are provided to students, and the nuanced needs these students have is an essential aspect of school social work and being a professional transitioning into and partnering with schools. Week four is asynchronous with readings from the textbook and Washington's K-12 education oversight body. Students will engage in forums and a quiz exploring special educational law. There is also a lecture video on implementing services in Washington State.

The agenda is as follows:

- Week four course plan
- General overview of special education
- Referral process for special services
- Positions and rolls
- Mandated reporting

The learning objectives for this week include:

- To gain knowledge regarding the legal landscape regarding disability services within a school setting
- To have an understanding of the obligations schools have to serve students with special needs
- To articulate ethical decision making

**A-02 Asynchronous Weekly Small Groups Discussion Forums**

[W-04 Small Group Discussion Forums](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_210-216.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=6681e465-f27e-4a6f-9422-f9d155b824ce)

Many students we work with in school social work have a disability and receive accommodations or specially designed educational programs. This week focuses on special education law and policies and how they impact decision-making in a school setting. **I am later than expected in submitting this week's course materials**. I am extending the deadline for your replies this week to Sunday night, and I do not have a synthesis post for the week. You can find what group you are in the [A-02 Group Assignments and Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9ac60a9e-af93-4ffa-a1b8-df0b7f662696) handout. Students must submit at least **three replies** in their group's forum this week. Two will be your original thoughts and reflections related to the prompts. The other one is flexible and focused on engaging with peers or the prompts. When you are not presenting your reflection on the given prompts, but replying to your peer's reflections, ensure that the post is meaningful and additive to the discussion (e.g., share personal insight, ask some questions, relate to your thoughts about the topic, etc.). This week's forums will allow students to explore the significance of due process hearings, ethical decision-making regarding students with special educational needs, the impact and implementation of the IEP, and how school social workers engage with special educational services.
