I hope everybody had a wonderful Spring Break! Here is all of the information that is also included in [W-10: 3/21 - 3/27](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-10_321_-_327.jnz)

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn:

Communication is an essential skill for social workers. Learning to effectively communicate and build relationships with persons with many different needs is crucial for all of us. Rothman's (2018) chapter 11 provides in-depth and practical application for how social workers can optimize communication and relationships with clients with special needs. The following are the learning objectives for week 10.

- Recognize worker skills that can enhance communication
- Identify the Communication Bill of Rights
- Learn to integrate client strengths to improve communication


## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Read Rothman's (2018) chapter 11, "Using Client Strengths and Worker Skills to Optimize Communication and Relationship."
- Watch the video NJC's Video [Principles and Practices for Working With Individuals With Severe Disabilities](https://www.asha.org/njc/njc-video-principles-and-practices-for-working-with-individuals-with-severe-disabilities/) This video is about 20 minutes but has a lot of good content in it. The various forums also ask you to relate to it.
- Watch my lecture video, [Week 10 - Teaching Students to Self-Advocate](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3ed9aa97-379b-4874-86ca-ae5e005e2900). There is also some information shared there about a previous assignment that I am only sharing there.

**A–01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

Students are to make at least three replies across any of the four open forums this week. Remember, the expectation is to read all of the posts. Your responses can include another student's reply if you contribute something substantial to the discussion. Be sure to post on two separate days to show engagement. The following are the four forums this week:

- The forum, [Chapter 11 Discussion Prompts](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-10_321_-_327.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=1e2190c1-4cca-453f-8c75-cc3705ba4744), provides five different potential discussion questions that come from the textbook
- [Trust and Relationship Building](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-10_321_-_327.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=3a14aa5a-3fb6-4039-8e98-6297a861ea0d) asks students to consider both the textbook and the video from the NJC's video and how that relates to building relationship and trust with clients. 
- Students [The Communication Bill of Rights and Communicating Across Disabilities](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-10_321_-_327.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=341065de-e076-4707-9598-bbb1b3b41101)
- We all need an excuse to watch a good movie. [Connecting with Disability Through Film](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-10_321_-_327.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=a7957e13-23d0-4e0c-be2e-c8ac68540d14) connects with some of the film resources offered in the textbook and asks students to watch a film and talk about it.

## Unit Resources:

A video from the National National Joint Committee for the Communication Needs of Persons With Severe Disabilities (n.d.) titled [Principles and Practices for Working With Individuals with Severe Disabilities](https://www.asha.org/njc/njc-video-principles-and-practices-for-working-with-individuals-with-severe-disabilities/) is assigned watching this week. As well, there is a call to read through and consider the Communication bill of Rights, which was published by [Brady et al. (2016)](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=ad1fd3ab-f02c-4ed7-8a3a-802464f5fb90). A couple of the discussion forums ask you to relate the video.

In my lecture video, [Week 10 - Teaching Students to Self-Advocate](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3ed9aa97-379b-4874-86ca-ae5e005e2900), I talk about three different papers about this topic. First, [McCarthy (2017)](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=680e40a4-d016-495d-b9cc-effa2c7d679a) provides an example of self-advocacy and youth with disabilities through the example of an encounter with a student. Second, [Downing et al. (2007)](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=680e40a4-d016-495d-b9cc-effa2c7d679a) is a study that helps to identify how to track self-advocacy. Finally, [Martin et al. (1993)](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=36761aaf-abf6-4f90-89d4-548b3462440a) is an older paper, but it describes what developing a transition plan is and how self-advocacy can fit throughout the K-12 experience for students. I've uploaded all of the articles and linked them if you would like to read them.
