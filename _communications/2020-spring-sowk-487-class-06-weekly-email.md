I hope that you are all doing well. I think class today should be a good one.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. This week the reading is:

- Garvin et al (2017) __Chapters 9-11__

The reading this week reviewed three different approaches for group work related to purpose. These were:

- __Self-Help and Support Groups__: Very related to the conversation we had regarding mutual aid groups and those concepts.
- __Psychoeducation Groups__: groups which are trying to either provide education, skill acquisition, and or self-knowledge.
- __Prevention Groups__: applying prevention concepts to a wide range of problems.

Today I want to spend time talking some about out prevention groups and psycho educational groups.

The agenda is: 

* Psychoeducational groups
* Public Health Framework
* Other prevention frameworks and models
* Designing a school based intervention


The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.

We talked about Grounding Techniques in class. This comes from Lisa M. Najavits (2002) workbook on [seeking safety](https://www.treatment-innovations.org/seeking-safety.html). Winona State University offers a helpful worksheet that discusses the skills. You can see the [Grounding Worksheet](https://www.winona.edu/resilience/Media/Grounding-Worksheet.pdf).

I also shared in class the curriculum that I adapted called the [Dragon Slayers Trauma Focused Teen / Pre-Teen Group Curriculum](/assets/media/dragon-slayers-trauma-focused-teen-pre-teen-group-curriculum), and you can look at that as well.
