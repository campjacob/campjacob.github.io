Sorry that I am posting this weeks content later then expected. Have a great week and let me know if there is anything I can do to support you.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week two is an asynchronous week. You will read and discuss the frequent tasks, roles, and skills needed for being a school-based social worker.

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Jarolmen and Bautista-Thomas (2023) _Chapter 2: A Typical Day?_

**A-02 Asynchronous Weekly Small Groups Discussion Forums**


[W-02 Small Group Discussion Forums](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/ðŸ’»_W-02_127-22.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=b1fad928-5469-4313-b450-7e83645866a6)

This week's focus is on the roles and skills of school social workers. You can find what group you are in the [A-02 Group Assignments and Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9ac60a9e-af93-4ffa-a1b8-df0b7f662696) handout. Students must submit at least **four replies** this week in their group's forum. Two will be your original thoughts and reflections related to the prompts. The other are flexible, either focused on engaging with your peers or the prompts. In replying to your peers, they must be meaningful and additive to the discussion. The discussion prompts focus on school social work roles (what they are, examples from practice, and things you want to do) and the skills necessary to do social school work (what they are, resources regarding skills, personal reflection, and connections with generalist practice).

This week, the first person on each group list is the leader (unless your group determines to have somebody else do it). It is the responsibility of the group as a whole that one of the members engages in this leadership role. This team leader will develop a reply in [W-02 Discussion Forum Synthesis](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/ðŸ’»_W-02_127-22.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=b5be2a71-0f5f-4e01-84b8-525c3e24d60d) that will provide an overview of your group's discussion. Even though only the team leader needs to post in this forum, I'd like for everybody to read it so you can hear what other groups discussed.


## Unit Resources

On Saturday, we assigned groups [A-02 Asynchronous Weekly Small Groups Discussion Forums Group Assignments and Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9ac60a9e-af93-4ffa-a1b8-df0b7f662696). The forums also provide a link to a page published by the School Social Work Association of America (n.d.) [Role of School Social Worker](https://www.swaa.org/school-social-work). 

I won't be posting a lecture video this week, as we talked about school social work roles during our in-person class.
