Looking forward to seeing you all on Wednesday! No reading quiz this week, although there is a journal article for you to consider reading.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 continues our work in _Week 10 Social Work Planning_. This week, we will focus on cognitive distortions and addressing them, primarily through the context of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). We will also examine crisis planning, how we document our plans, and task management. The plan is as follows:

- Talk about cognitive distortions and cognitive restructuring
- The planning process in crisis
- Documenting our plans
- Task Management

## Unit Assignments

Attend class

## Unit Resources

We will be talking some about documentation. Reamer provides a useful description of what social workers should be thinking about in regards to documentation. He reports about six primary functions of documentation. These include:

> (1) assessment and planning; (2) service delivery; (3) continuity and coordination of services; (4) supervision; (5) service evaluation; and (6) accountability to clients, insurers, agencies, other providers, courts, and utilization review bodies. (Reamer, 2005, p. 326)

I would recommend student take some time and review the article and consider how it will impact their documentation (see article [Reamer (2005) Documentation in social work](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=69011b41-2b98-4e2d-9241-125e2df8349f)).

We also watch a short talk by Burns (2014) during class that is a pretty powerful story. If you are interested in finding it later you can see it at [Feeling good - David Burns - TEDxReno](https://youtu.be/H1T5uMeYv9Q). There are also handouts [Fixing Cognitive Distortions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=c161a053-4e9d-46b5-87d0-f675984e8a09) and [Goal Planning and Progress Note](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=54985696-87c2-4cab-8d52-1a8021e5b61e) that I will be printing and bringing for use in class.
