## Unit Assignments

You all have made it. I have made it! We are having a joint potluck on Wednesday starting at 5:30. It will be fun. Feel free to bring some games or activities we can do, and you can share what you are bringing to the [Spring 2025 Joined 487w and 460w Celebration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17chSDf-xr36kRweJaLi_7uN9ZjutHs8sdfg6vwmYFic/edit?usp=sharing), which is this Wednesday. Also, please complete your end-of-course evaluations. I only have 6 of the expected 21.
