## Unit Resources

During class, we will review an article by Clarke et al. (2022) as an example of a program evaluation and how it connects with culturally responsive practices. The article, [Empowering Indigenous Communities Through a Participatory, Culturally Responsive Evaluation of a Federal Program for Older Americans](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10982140211030557), is open access so that you can download and read it directly from the publisher. We will also be looking at one of the Appendices from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2014), which you can find as a stand-alone document [Evaluation Standards and Strategies to Increase Cultural Competence](https://www.cdc.gov/national-asthma-control-program/media/pdfs/2024/05/evaluation_standards_and_strategies.pdf).

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Spring 2025 SOWK 460w Week 12 - Research Context and Cultural Competence](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/zvIROO).
