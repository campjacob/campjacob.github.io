I hope you are all doing well. I know that we Thanksgiving is this week, and many of your teachers don't have class this week. If you aren't able to join, just let me know. Otherwise, I think it will be a valuable class session. We will only be online, so there will be no in person portion this week. The link for zoom is on the My Heritage course page (on the main page).


## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Assessments are an essential aspect of social work and direct practice with clients. We should be participating in assessments of our practice and the interventions that we complete with clients. There are many ways to go through that. The schedule for today is to look at the following:

-  Evaluation
-  The evaluation process
-  Termination
-  Follow up
-  Self Care


## Unit Resources

We are talking about assessment in class this week. It is also time for the evaluation of the class. I do value feedback. The results of the survey tool are confidential so I don’t receive any names related to specific responses. There should be a spot for you to be able to take the evaluation on the sidebar or [CourseEval](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2122_FA-SOWK_486W-3/Main_Page.jnz?tool=courseEvalInt) (link might work, it does for me).

### **Assignment 5: Extra Credit Assignment Options**

The faculty for this course offers students two different opportunities for extra credit. The first is a smaller assignment for evaluating your own communication style and use of empathetic conversation through a reflective paper. The second is a more intensive research paper looking into evidence-based assessment practices or generalist practice intervention for social workers. These assignments are extra credit and not mandatory.
