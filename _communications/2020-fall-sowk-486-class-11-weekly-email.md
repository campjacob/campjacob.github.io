I hope that you are all doing well! I'm looking forward to seeing you all on Monday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 is looking at how we effect change with our clients. This is generally the goal with most services we provide as social workers. To understand how we effect change, we will look at following:

- Additive Empathy & Interpretation
- Confrontation
- Barriers to change
