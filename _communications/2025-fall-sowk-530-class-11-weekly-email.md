## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 is a synchronous week with class on Saturday (11/08/25). Students read two chapters from Hepworth et al. (2023) focused on the planning and implementation stages of the planned change process. They engage in a reading quiz and have forums exploring content from the readings, looking at Cognitive Behavioral Therapy through the lens of Thinking Distortions, and a talk by David Burns. During the in-person class session, the focus will be on the goal-formulation process. An agenda and learning objectives will be updated later.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 12 _Developing Goals and Formulating a Contract_
- Read Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 13 _Planning and Implementing Change-Oriented Strategies_
- Watch TEDx Talks (2014) David Burns - Feeling Good

**W-11 A-02 Asynchronous Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are four forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- The [Chapters 12 and 13 Content Discussion](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-11_113-119.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=88c740a9-4d4d-415a-b783-509b9bdf4910) offers a broad menu of prompts for students to explore.
- In [Examples of Planning Forms](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-11_113-119.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=2daa84d9-4b21-48da-93ca-27e6ed3ea7b9), students are encouraged to share real planning tools—such as treatment or service plans—from practicum or external sources, fostering applied learning around social work documentation.

- Students examine common cognitive distortions, offering definitions and real-world/media examples in the [Thinking Distortions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-11_113-119.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=5a783c08-a12d-484a-9810-360ca9ba0a9f) discussion forum.
