## Unit Resources

During class, we reviewed the [flyer for presentations](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=59852312-783c-4da0-823f-a2b2066ae2e0). We also created a survey, that you can [access to edit in Microsoft Forms](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?subpage=design&FormId=mlmXan5KOES6ffFDvDcevHtyHB-2cQVOrTak2DaV6wJURExKT0Y0RkpDRVBKNkxTWk82MDRDNVhSSi4u&Token=574bdc388d054e0bb2325a1e6f8f934f) or to be able [to take the survey](https://forms.office.com/r/HtMrBvWWRR). After the data has been collected, you will be able to see/edit it in a `[Spreadsheet]()`.

This week, I drew some of the source material from a couple of articles. We listen to a story called [The Blind Men and the Elephant](https://youtu.be/bJVBQefNXIw). In discussing triangulation, I draw from Thurmond (2001) to share the types of triangulation we consider. We also consider Midway (2020) as we discuss data visualization. 

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Spring 2025 SOWK 460w Week 13 - Interpreting Findings Analyzing and Understanding Data for Program Evaluation](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/v9S4Vx).
