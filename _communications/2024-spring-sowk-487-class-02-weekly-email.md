I'm looking forward to seeing you this week and seeing you all in person this week. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

For the first four weeks of class, we will focus on groups in family work. This week you will read Hepworth et al. (2022) _Chapter 10 Assessing Family Functioning in Diverse Family and Cultural Contexts_. The assessment is the foundation for any successful service. Some of the dimensions we must look at include: family structure, including homeostasis, boundaries, power and decision-making, roles, rules, life cycle, and sociopolitical environment

- Strengths perspective and families
- Engagement and assessment with families

Because we met online last week and didn't pick groups, we will also do that during this class session.

## Unit Resources

During class, we will do an activity using the handout [Applying Family Systems Framework Assessment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=4e7bb8c5-81a0-477b-ac4d-dbb906109176). This week, we will discuss the first two scenarios and brainstorm what going through an assessment might be like. Next week, you will have the opportunity to role-play some.

We will watch a video, [Insoo Kim Berg Solution-Focused Family Therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Fe8D0hAQh0), and talk about the communication styles of the family members.
