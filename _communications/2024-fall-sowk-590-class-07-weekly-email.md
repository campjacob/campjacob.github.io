I'm looking forward to hearing about the work you are all doing in your practicums this Saturday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week seven is synchronous with having class on Saturday (10/05/24) week for SOWK 590. We will have the following agenda:

- SLED: Intersectionality and Identity
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider intersectionality and identity.

## Unit Resources

The mindfulness activity we are doing this week will be engaging with [Dr. Dan Siegel's wheel of awareness](https://drdansiegel.com/wheel-of-awareness/). You can find the audio and more information on his website. You can find the presentation [Fall 2024 SOWk 590 Week 07 - Advanced Seminar I](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=c5c1b79d-00bb-4b6c-81b4-116ed667de74).

Because I go between Toppenish and Tri-Cities and end up have things frequently going on, I made a place that you can also go to check in if I am on campus if you want to connect with me in person (you can still always just text me too). You can find it at <https://vsp.ink/now>.

You can find all of the [lecture videos for SOWK 590](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_590/2425_FA-SOWK_590-1/Lecture_Videos.jnz?). `This weeks lecture, [Fall 2024 SOWK 590 (1) - Week 07]().`
