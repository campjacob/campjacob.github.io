## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Social workers are frequently placed in settings serving students with disabilities and need to understand and interface with special educational services. Having specific knowledge of special education law, how services are provided to students, and the nuanced needs of these students is an essential aspect of school social work and of being a professional transitioning into and partnering with schools. Week four is asynchronous with readings from the textbook and Washington's K-12 education oversight body. Students will engage in forums and a quiz exploring special educational law. There is also a lecture video on implementing services in Washington State.

The agenda is as follows:

- Week four course plan
- General overview of special education
- Referral process for special services
- Positions and roles
- Mandated reporting

The learning objectives for this week include:

- To gain knowledge regarding the legal landscape of disability services within a school setting
- To have an understanding of the obligations schools have to serve students with special needs
- To articulate ethical decision-making

**W-04 A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are _three forums_ for this week, and you are expected to make at least **4 replies** across any of the forums and read all of your peers' replies. These forums include the following:

- Students review real-world [due process hearing decisions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/💻_W-04_29-215.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=b5eb27a9-e88a-4714-9328-a8262bf477a6) from OSPI to better understand the legal and policy frameworks guiding special education disputes.
- In [School Law and Decision Making](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/💻_W-04_29-215.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=a9e1537b-81a9-4025-bda2-c2330af743c7), students identify potential ethical dilemmas in school settings and explore how to apply ethical frameworks to guide decision-making.
- The [Chapter 4 discussion](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/💻_W-04_29-215.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=a4cdabf5-66da-4631-93df-0a05c290858a) encourages students to reflect on IDEA 2004's impact, family involvement, remote learning, and school social work practices, drawing from case examples and self-reflection prompts in the textbook.

Along with your replies in the forum, this week you have a quiz (see [W-04 Quiz Regarding Understanding Special Education Law](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=ebdd480c-2195-41b5-9ee6-728f67e027e2)) based on the _Notice of Special Education Procedural Safeguards for Students and Their Families_ reading this week.
