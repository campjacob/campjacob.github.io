I have now posted the lecture video for this week. I hope it is useful. Make sure you listen to the end, as I share my plan for week 10 that you all might like. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

There is a wide range of school-related problems that social workers can assist in addressing through evidence-based practices and community, human, and technological resources. Week eight, an asynchronous week, is designed to support students in gaining a more well-defined understanding of problems and awareness of resources that can help address these problems. Students will read chapter eight of Jarolmen and Batista-Thomas (2023), which reviews issues critical for school social workers. Students engage in forums related to sharing their experiences of problems, exploring a broad range of resources. The lecture video for students this week includes practical content about saving resources to share with clients and colleagues and the fact sheet assignment.

The agenda for the lecture video is as follows:

- Content for week eight
- Saving informational resources
- School-related problem fact sheet

The learning objectives for week eight include:

- Identify and define school-related problems social workers commonly encounter.
- Demonstrate an understanding of various resources (human, community, and technological) that can be leveraged to address school-related challenges.
- Evaluate strategies for effectively integrating community resources into school settings to provide wraparound services, particularly in rural and small district contexts.
- Demonstrate practical skills in collecting, organizing, and sharing informational resources valuable for professional social work practice in schools.


## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Jarolmen and Batista-Thomas (2023) _Chapter 8: Current Societal Issues Affecting Children in Schools_
- Watch the forthcoming lecture video

[W-08 Small Group Discussion Forums](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/ðŸ’»_W-08_310-316.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=1575c65e-b538-4db0-b300-c1d410167127)

To address common issues affecting students in schools, social workers must be knowledgeable about the presenting problems and the resources that can be used to help address the challenges of those issues. You can find what group you are in the [A-02 Group Assignments and Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9ac60a9e-af93-4ffa-a1b8-df0b7f662696) handout. Students must submit at least **five replies** this week in their group's forum. Competency G, as identified in the _Professional Transitions to Public Schools Coursework Requirement_ (2021, see WAC 181-79A-224), is focused on students demonstrating an understanding of various resources (including human, community, and technological). This week's content, along with the factsheet and intervention plans due later in the semester, is focused on supporting this. The discussion prompts include students exploring and defining a school-related problem. Students can share and hear about community resources, helping provide context for how those resources can be used and how they can be integrated into a school-based setting. Students will also consider technological and human resources and examples of their use. Culturally responsive practices and how they connect with resources are also to be discussed, along with the place that policy has in considering school-related problems.

This week, the **fifth person** on each group list is the leader (unless your group determines to have somebody else do it). It is the responsibility of the group as a whole that one of the members engages in this leadership role. This team leader will develop a reply in [W-08 Discussion Forum Synthesis](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/ðŸ’»_W-08_310-316.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=e2db4029-4fd8-4d2b-b25c-58f74b1a73e8) that will provide an overview of your group's discussion. Even though only the team leader needs to post in this forum, I'd like for everybody to read it so you can hear what other groups discussed.


## Unit Resources

I have posted A-04 School-Related Problem Fact Sheet more detailed [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=5f394095-5e4d-46aa-867c-1496a45b0f4b) and we will talk about the assignment in my lecture video. If you you are interested, I have an infographic I created on creativity [Creators on Creating Book [Infographic]](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/09/creators-on-creating-book-infographic/).

In my lecture video I show my strategy for keeping my informational resources. The app that I use is called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), but years ago when I first started doing this I just had a folder of Word documents.
