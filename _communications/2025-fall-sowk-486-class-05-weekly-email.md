See you all on Wednesday!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

The focus of week five for SOWK 486 is on communication skills. There are many that Hepworth et al. (2023) term as verbal following skills. Rogers (1957), who developed the concept of person-centered counseling, described what he called the facilitative condition. This includes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence. He proposed that when clinicians can maintain these aspects, they can support and help promote positive changes in their clients. The plan for today is to talk about the core skills that help clinicians help their clients. The plan is as follows:

- The Facilitative Conditions
- Empathy
- Authenticity
- Praise

Learning Objectives This Week Include:

- Demonstrate an understanding of the facilitative conditions (empathy, respect, authenticity) and their application in helping relationships.
- Practice recognizing and responding to client emotions using levels of empathic communication and reciprocal empathy strategies.
- Apply principles of authenticity to build trust and connection.

## Unit Resources

Cultural humility is an important aspect of communication. I value the concept of cultural humility. Chavez (2013) offers a 30-minute documentation, [_Cultural Humility: People, Principles, and Practices_](https://youtu.be/SaSHLbS1V4w), helps understand this concept.

We listen to a short excerpt from Brené Brown's TED talk, [The Power of Vulnerability](https://youtu.be/iCvmsMzlF7o) during class. The whole thing is great, and I would recommend it if you are interested. It also gives a good example of qualitative research. It is about 20 minutes.

In the excerpt we use, Brown discusses Wiseman (2007) and her definition of empathy. Wiseman's paper is related to nursing practice, but the general concepts in her _Toward a Holistic Conceptualization of Empathy for Nursing Practice_ are beneficial, and I've attached it if you are interested in reviewing it.
