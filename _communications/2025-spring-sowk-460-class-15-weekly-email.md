You are almost finished. This week, work on your papers/presentations. Next week presentations. Then the week after, celebrate! You got this!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 15 is asynchronous, so there is no in-person class. Students are working on finalizing their presentations (and final papers). To give students focused time preparing for the end of the semester, there are no forums. Students have one final journal to complete.

## Unit Assignments

**A-04a Individual Weekly Journal Entries**

You can find the forum for the last journal entry at [W-15 A-04a Journal Entry 10](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=38dba1c9-eecd-42cd-b872-65390615737e).

**A-04: Group Program Evaluation Project**

The majority of the coursework for this class is related to the students' group program evaluation project. The assignment has been broken up into smaller parts. The culmination of this assignment is a final executive summary style paper and a presentation discussing the results of the completed program evaluation. Students work as a learning team to complete this assignment, with groups of three to five students. These teams will cooperatively create the executive summary and give the final presentation. Students will also jointly develop the group logic model and group work plan. Each group member will also be responsible for posting in their weekly journal.

**A-04e: Program Evaluation Group Presentation**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 200 pts (20% of student's final grade); _Deadline_ During class Monday 05/05/25; _Submission_ via in-person presentation; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=edaeafa0-32df-4988-8a23-6de3069791c2) and [Syllabus Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9c042a62-cc96-4f13-8130-577038bcbc74).

**Purpose**:  Sharing the results of our research is a vital aspect of the research process. This presentation allows students to provide an academic presentation regarding their research findings. Furthermore, it will enable students to formally present their findings to agency staff and effectively disseminate their research.

**Task**:  Along with submitting the final paper for the student's research project, it is also recommended that students return their findings to the agency where they complete their program evaluation through a presentation. Along with offering the agency a copy of the final report, students will invite staff to participate in a final presentation to discuss their findings. This final presentation will occur during week 16, on Monday 05/05/25, during class time. If students would like to present at an earlier week to accommodate the program evaluation stakeholders' time, they can request this from the instructor. The group presentation is about 15 to 20 minutes long. All the students will receive the same grade for the presentation, and each student is expected to have some part in presenting. Presentations will approximately follow a format like the one listed here:

1. Introduction and Stakeholder Engagement (3 slides)
	a. Introduction (1 slide)  
	b. Evaluation Purpose (1 slide)  
	c. Stakeholders (1 slide)  
2. Cultural Competence (1 slide)
3. Description of the Program Being Evaluated (1 slide)
4. Logic Model (1 slide)
5. Evaluation Design (2 slides)
	a. Evaluation Questions (1 slide)  
	b. Design, Methods, Indicators & Standards (1 slide)  
6. Analysis, Results, & Interpretation (5 to 8 slides)
	a. Analysis (1 slide)  
	b. Results (3-5 slides)  
	c. Interpretation (1-2 slides)  
7. Use & Dissemination (1 slide)
8. References (1 slide)

**Success**: Students will perform a presentation using strong presentation skills and sharing relevant information from their research project. See Appendix D _Academic Presentation Rubric for the Program Evaluation_ for the basis of the feedback and grades. I will provide feedback before final grades are due by Wednesday 05/21/25 at 5:00 PM.

**Appendices D. Academic Presentation Rubric for the Program Evaluation**

The _Academic Presentation Rubric for Program Evaluation_ evaluates organization, content, references, and delivery. The organization section assesses audience targeting, topic alignment, accuracy, and logical flow. Content evaluates adherence to assignment requirements. APA formatting and style are also assessed. Delivery assesses visual aids for quantity, clarity, attractiveness, and relevance.

| Description | Initial | Emerging | Developed | Highly Developed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Presentation Organization: <br>(audience, topic, accuracy, and logical sequence) | Zero to one of the four assessed areas fits the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | At least two of the four assessed areas fit the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | At least three assessed areas fit the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | Audience: The presentation targets a scholarly audience with limited subject knowledge. Topic: It accurately follows the issues described in the syllabus. Accuracy: The information provided is factual and brought from scholarly sources. Logical Sequence: The presentation follows a logical and goal-oriented sequence that provides sufficient context for the audience. |
| Presentation Content: <br>(follows assignment description) | The presentation does not follow the assignment description for what content to include. | The presentation includes five of the assigned content areas. | The presentation includes seven of the assigned content areas. | The presentation provides information related to all of the identified components, including an introduction, stakeholder engagement, cultural competence, program description, logic model, evaluation design, analysis, use plan, and references. |
| Presentation Content: <br>(references) | References are not provided or discussed during the presentation. | There appears to be some attempt to describe the sources of information provided. | The presentation includes a reference list that generally looks like APA format. | The presentation slides include in-text citations identifying the sources of information throughout the presentation. The end of the presentation contains a reference list with citation entries in APA format. During the presentation delivery, the speaker will refer to the studies and their authors where appropriate. |
| Presentation Delivery:<br>Visual Aids (quantity, attractiveness, clear, and additive) | Zero or one of the four assessed areas fits the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | At least two of the four assessed areas fit the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | At least three assessed areas fit the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | Quantity: There are enough slides used in the presentation to provide a visual aid for the information required. Attractiveness: the slides are visually appealing. A theme is in the presentation. Clear: The slides are easy to read and do not contain too much text. Additive: The visuals used in the presentation are appropriate and enhance the message. |
