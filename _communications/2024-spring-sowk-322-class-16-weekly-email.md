Week 16 we bring to a close this class. I hope it has been a helpful class, and you have learned a lot! This week there is a chapter to read, and I would encourage you to dive into learning about social and recreational support for persons with disabilities.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 16 we bring to a close this class. I hope it has been a helpful class, and you have learned a lot! I have enjoyed facilitating the class.  This week there is a chapter to read, and I would encourage you to dive into learning about social and recreational support for persons with disabilities.

- Learn about social support and recreation for persons with disabilities
- Reflect on accessibility in our communities
- Identify three things learned in the class
- Complete Course Evaluations


## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Read Rothman's (2018) chapter 21, "The Social Support and Recreation Network."
- Watch my lecture video, [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 - Week 16](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e0d4ede6-e1a6-4303-94b1-b1610025b735)

**Aâ€“01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

Students are to make at least one reply in each open forum this week. Remember, the expectation is to read all of the posts. Your responses can include another student's reply if you contribute something substantial to the discussion. Be sure to post on two separate days to show engagement. The forums include the following:

- I do really value feedback and want to be the best teacher I can be. To encourage this, one of the forums requires you to attest that you have completed your [Course Evaluation](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-16_429_-_55.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=3f808f5a-149a-4283-9cff-73545a7decf6).
- I also want you to learn as much as you can. There is a forum, the [Course Wrap-Up](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-16_429_-_55.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=0998aadc-2a1a-4666-8a28-2fb50481108e) that I ask you to write three things you will be taking away from this class.
- The forum, [Chapter 21 Questions or Textbook Feedback](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-16_429_-_55.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=521f7a3b-1ff0-41e8-a682-8b28e80eb83f) gives some questions to consider in light of the reading. I also allowed this forum to be a space to talk about the textbook. I think the reading this week is good and valuable, but if you are done with reading just review the review the textbook, and that is ok (or if you don't like the other questions).


**A-05: Accessibility in Your Community Reflection Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 100 pts (16% of total points); _Deadline_ Friday 05/03/24 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ via an uploaded paper in My Heritage Assignments; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=caf19a3b-7b20-43af-855b-8692b564b6d8) and [Syllabus Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=f3554863-d14e-45a1-ad8d-bb1d7dbd43dd)

**Purpose**: Accessibility is an essential area needing advocacy for persons with disabilities. This project encourages students to increase their awareness of accessibility in community settings.

**Task**: Students are to take an outing into the community. This can be anywhere. Consider a trip to the grocery store, dropping children off at school, getting takeout from a restaurant, an errand in a government building, a visit to the mall, an outing to the library, etc. During class, we will be learning about accessibility and mobility. When you go on your excursion, notice how the environment is accessible. Notice the ways the environment is not accessible. This can include wheelchair access, other mobility access, and access for people with visual or auditory differences or issues with sensory input or communication disorders, etc. Write a reflection about your observations, including photos or other evidence. Include both things that enhance accessibility (strengths) and suggestions for improving accessibility.

**Success**: Students will write an edited and reflective essay about their experience on an outing. The paper should be between 500 and 750 words in length. It should include a title page and title at the start of your paper. The general page format of an APA paper is expected. Most students will not need to include in-text citations or their corresponding reference list entries. Still, if you pull information from other sources in your writing, they should be done following APA format. Photos in the paper should be included as figures and include captions. Papers will be graded based on the reflective paper rubric in the appendix of this syllabus.

**Extra Credit Options**

There are two identified extra credit assignments for this class. The first is a reflective paper with more minor requirements, and the second is a research paper. 

**A-06a - Extra Credit - Crip Camp Film Reflective Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 50 extra credit points (8% of total points); _Deadline_ Friday 05/03/24 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ Submit this as a file upload in the My Heritage Assignments; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=72a5d4b5-da92-4c9c-9f3e-9e79f30a9cbf) and [Syllabus Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=2ab5bfdb-469a-40d0-86c7-2993a32731be)

**Purpose**: Extra credit is offered to allow students to make up work that they missed during some of the class sessions. Students are offered a chance to consider the impact of such camps on individuals and society.

**Task**: Newnham and Lebrecht's (2020) film _Crip Camp__: A Disability Revolution_ can be found on Netflix, has received positive reviews, and won some awards. Early in the semester, when discussing disability activists, we will talk briefly about Camp Jened, a camp for people with disabilities in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Extra credit is available if you want to watch the film and write a brief reflection. I would not like to see a summary of the film, but instead your reaction to it. Describe your thoughts about the camp, its meaning, its role in history, its impacts on the residents (positive or negative), and anything else you'd like to share.

**Success**: Students will watch the film and write a reflective paper. Papers should be between 500 and 750 words in length. It should include a title page, title at the start of the article, and in-text/reference list entries for citations following APA formatting.

**A-06b - Extra Credit - Disability Population Research Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 100 extra credit points (16% of total points); _Deadline_ Friday 05/03/24 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ Submit this as a file upload in the My Heritage Assignments; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=d976f492-d3c0-4d16-930f-f82cef6baf23) and [Syllabus Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=a7f83f34-3171-41e1-891e-480de828956e)

**Purpose**: Extra credit is offered to allow students to make up work that they missed during some of the class sessions. Students are allowed to expand their completed presentation into a scholarly writing project.

**Task**: Students can take a population, most with disabilities, and write a research paper based on the population. The paper would follow the same format as the presentations that students completed. However, students would not be required to use the same population as their presentation (although this would be advised because of the previous work conducted in preparing the presentation). 

**Success**: Students will submit a research paper that discusses a specific population with disabilities. They will incorporate the same expectations as the presentation regarding what information to include. Papers will be between 1,500 and 1,750 words in length. Papers will follow proper APA formatting and include a title page, abstract, title of the paper, in-text citations, and corresponding reference list entries. Grades will be assessed using the APA research paper rubric included in the appendix of this syllabus.


## Unit Resources

For your accessibility in the community reflection paper, make sure that you format the title page as an APA student paper (see [Title Page Setup](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/title-page) or [Student Paper Examples](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/sample-papers)). You can also see how to [format your figures](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures/figures) (for your photos you will include).

To finding your course evaluations, students can use a computer or their mobile device to log in to MyHeritage, click on the Academics tab, and then click on CoursEval. As a reminder, CoursEval and requires that your pop-up blocker be turned off. I believe that you can also go to the following link (at least it works for faculty) - [Course Eval](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=80D1DC0A-3F3A-4F42-AE34-3F64A45A24E3&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=T0JQU8Y313).
