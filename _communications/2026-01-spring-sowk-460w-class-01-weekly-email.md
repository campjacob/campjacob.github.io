I'm still working on preparing the weeks course page, but I wanted to give you a heads-up on expectations this week.

I created a lecture video to review the syllabus. If you have questions about the syllabus/course, we can follow up on them during class on Monday. Otherwise, I didn't want to use our time this week to go through it. You can find it at [Spring 2026 SOWK 460 Week 01 Syllabus Review](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=46cff4b8-2fb9-44a7-be26-b3d900645573)

The [course syllabus](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2526_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Syllabus.jnz) (you can download a [PDF version](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=7f82b152-08aa-4459-b18a-8474effe9402)) drives the entire course and has a lot of information that can be useful. My video goes through some of it, but I'd encourage you to read it through.

I have a contact form that I would like you to complete. You can find it at (<https://forms.office.com/r/1rBKCvdZJE>).

You can start reading through chapter 1 for next weeks class. I don't have any forums this week.

I look forward to seeing you all on Monday. Let me know if there is anything you might need.
