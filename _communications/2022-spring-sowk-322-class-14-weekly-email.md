The end of the semester is coming up really quick. I hope that you are all doing well.


## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn:

Week 14, we move closer to the end of the semester and this course. I hope it has been a good experience for everybody and that you have learned a lot. This week we start to look at the material that we will cover in your final paper. The following are the learning objectives for this week:

- Explore concepts of mobility and access
- Apply mobility and access concepts to student's own experiences
- Integrate improved access to social work practice


## Unit Assignment

**Read/Watch**

- Read Rothman's (2018) chapter 22, "Mobility, Access, and Adaptive Technology"
- Watch Roy (2015) [When We Design for Disability, We all Benefit](https://www.ted.com/talks/elise_roy_when_we_design_for_disability_we_all_benefit)

**Aâ€“01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

Students are to make at least three replies across any of the five open forums this week. Remember, the expectation is to read all of the posts. Your responses can include another student's reply if you contribute something substantial to the discussion. Be sure to post on two separate days to show engagement. 

Three forums are related to accessibility in our environments, whether in our homes, transportation, or our neighborhoods. The forms for discussion of each of these topics include:

- [Adaptable Living Spaces](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-14_418_-_424.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=74c4b27a-6567-46cd-9d06-6097bce7e164)
- [Accessibility in the Built Environment: Transportation](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-14_418_-_424.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=74eead48-7851-4e97-a147-6c0b82207f32)
- [Accessibility in the Built Environment: Neighborhood Mobility](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-14_418_-_424.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=15f5b84a-918f-419d-9dac-1b86d789d52e)

I also have students watch a Roy's (2015) TEDx talk and discuss it in the forum - [Discussion of Elise Roy's TEDx Talk - When we design for disability, we all benefit](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-14_418_-_424.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=2eef8832-b924-49cc-9382-a21d7d5dea84).

Finally, even though the end of the semester is still a couple of weeks away, students can start to ask questions about their final paper in the forum [Questions about Assignment 05: Accessibility in Your Community Reflection Paper](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-14_418_-_424.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=19ccbd65-df08-4694-b8de-c9abaca8336d).

**A-04: Analysis of Activist Work on Social Media**

[A-04: Analysis of Activist Work on Social Media](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=c8fb4b96-8035-46b3-87a7-5db5717ff598) is due Sunday 04/24/22 at 11:55 PM via an uploaded paper in [My Heritage Assignments](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=e1a53993-15d1-4118-b4dd-2e61cb8579ae). There was a lot of great questions and my responses two weeks ago in the forum [Questions Regarding A-04 Social Media Assignment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-12_44_-_410.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=4d3173d2-cb46-4dd5-b4da-b1e02b82269c). I would encourage students to check there if you have questions first.


## Unit Resources

There is no lecture video this week, but students are to watch Roy's (2015) [When We Design for Disability, We all Benefit](https://www.ted.com/talks/elise_roy_when_we_design_for_disability_we_all_benefit).

<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/elise_roy_when_we_design_for_disability_we_all_benefit" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

The forum [Adaptable Living Spaces](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-14_418_-_424.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=74c4b27a-6567-46cd-9d06-6097bce7e164), encourages students to browse through Johnson et al. (1999) report, [Home Modifications and Products for Safety and Ease of Use](https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/pubs_p/docs/Home%20Modifications%20and%20Products.pdf). The Institute for Human Centered Design (2016), which came out of the New England ADA Center published a checklist for what should be considered in existing facilities to verify that they meet standards. You can browse through the [ADA Checklist for Existing Facilities](https://www.adachecklist.org/doc/fullchecklist/ada-checklist.pdf). I am also a bit of a technology nerd and primarily related to Apple. Apple (2020) published an article about design with accessibility built-in that is interesting. You can read the article [Apple, Creatives, and Disability Rights Activists Reflect on 30 years of the Americans with Disabilities Act](https://nr.apple.com/dE7a8d6g5n).
