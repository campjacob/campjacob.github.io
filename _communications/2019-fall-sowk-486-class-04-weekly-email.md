I hope that you are all doing well. I'm looking forward to class today. To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. Don't forget to complete the reading quiz found on the MyHeritage class forum. This week the reading is:

- Hepworth et al. (2017) __Chapters 3 and 4__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Overview of the three phases of the the helping process
- Setting the environment
- Interviewing clients

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
