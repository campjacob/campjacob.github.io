Greetings from Spokane and the [Washington State NASW Conference](https://naswwa.socialworkers.org/Professional-Development/2024-NASW-WA-Conference). I hope you all are doing well. I have updated the page for SOWk 590 with our agenda and a reminder about who is doing the student led discussion. I hope you are all doing well and I will see you on Saturday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week five is synchronous with having class on Saturday (09/21/24) week for SOWK 590. I'm going to re-arrange the order of our seminar class so that the student led discussion will go first (that way we can dedicate the rest of the time to the practice reflection group. We will have the following agenda:

- SLED: Restorative Justice Practices
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider Restorative Justice Practices.

**Learning Contracts**

I've met with most of you for your learning contracts and if we haven't we have made a plan. I will be bringing some for people to put final signatures on, and some of you are supposed to bring your to me so I can sign. 

**Student Led Discussion**

If you said you would take on talking about restorative justice practice this week, be thinking about some potential questions or have a presentation prepared (like your peers did the last week).

## Unit Resources

Because I go between Toppenish and Tri-Cities and end up have things frequently going on, I made a place that you can also go to check in if I am on campus if you want to connect with me in person (you can still always just text me too). You can find it at <https://vsp.ink/now>.
