## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

We are in Week 8, and we are at the end of our two weeks of presentations! There will be no quizzes or videos. Instead, all weekly points will come from discussion participation. The objectives are as follows:

- Students will learn from each other by providing group presentations on selected topics.
- Students will demonstrate the ability to gather information about conditions.

## Unit Assignments

1. **If you are presenting this week**
	- Make sure someone in your group posts the presentation in the appropriate thread by 9:00 AM on Monday.
	- As a group, respond to all questions and comments your presentation receives. All group members do not have to respond to every comment, but each person should be present in the thread and contribute something. 
2. **If you are NOT presenting this week**
	- Please view all the presentations.
	- Please make at least three substantive comments or questions on three separate presentations.
	- At least one reply should be during early on in the week
	- Comments should include enough content to allow for dialog with the presenters. Questions are highly encouraged.
	

## Unit Resources

I really value feedback about how the classes I teach are going. There are two opportunities each semester, first in the middle of the semester and then in the end, to provide feedback about the course. I do read this and have an honest desire to be the best teacher I can be. I'd be grateful if you would consider completing the [Spring 2024 Midterm Feedback for SOWK 322 Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=C4891C44-BE32-4F73-B833-B79DDAF1D794&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=Z0Z03QV313).

While it is the same information that is in the syllabus, there is a handout - [Assignment 03: Disability Population Group Presentation Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=a985ea67-9790-405a-857d-95407f718545).
