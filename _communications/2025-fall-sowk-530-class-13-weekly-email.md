## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 13 is synchronous with a class session on Saturday (11/22/25). Students will read about barriers that make change hard for clients and how we might limit those barriers in our practice (Hepworth et al, 2025). There are forums for reflection on the reading, for sharing personal experiences of making individual change, and a space to explore cultural and racial dynamics and the impact they might have on our helping relationships with clients—the agenda for the in-person session to come.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 18 _Managing Barriers to Change_

**W-13 A-02 Asynchronous Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are three forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- The [Chapter 18 Discussion](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-13_1117-1123.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=3fec170a-fb6a-4181-9eb3-fa49806da1bb) invites students to engage with a range of advanced clinical topics from the reading.
- Students can explore their own lived experiences of trying to make meaningful change in the forum [Personal Examples of Challenges Making Change](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-13_1117-1123.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=5fecffea-d05f-4611-a5ed-7b4543dc4543).
