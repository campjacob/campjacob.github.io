I hope you are all well and I will see you next week for class.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Weeks eight and nine are both about how social workers conduct assessments. After we have started building relationships with our clients, and before we can find ways to support them, we must understand the real problem. We will be looking at how we do assessments. We will review examples of screening tools, talk about the DSM-5 and its uses, and discuss mini-mental status exams. Furthermore, I will show some examples of how I do documentation.

## Unit Resources

I really appreciate feedback about teaching and my courses. There is an opportunity to provide mid-term feedback. I read the feedback and find it helpful. You can access the survey by going to [SOWK 486W Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=592D6B7C-DCF0-497B-97D1-1FDCC1DCB7DC&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=50NOHE4307)

We talk some about the DSMâ€“5, and the ethics around using diagnosis. Shackle (1985) provides some arguments that are still relevant today in considering the DSM and its use. Graybeal (2001) provides a good description of how we can think of assessment from a strength-based approach versus the traditional medical model. Both articles are fairly short and approachable. I'd encourage you to read them. I shared the Graybeal article in week 2 so you have probably already read it and it's discussion of using ROPES in assessments.

In looking at assessment, it might be helpful to think about how assessment connects with intervention. Wolraich et al. (2011) information about diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). I created a video talking about [ADHD Information for Practitioners, Parents, and Schools](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/01/adhd-information-practitioners-parents-schools/) that might be useful.

Dr. Beverly Ford describes the assessment process that gives some insight into why assessment in the video the [Assessment Process](https://youtu.be/kagGIylgAnw) by Oregon DHS.

Some of the apps that I share and use when I am talking about my documentation are as follows:

- [Drafts | Where Text Starts](https://getdrafts.com/) on iOS and macOS
- [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/) on iOS, macOS, and Windows
- [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios)

I share some examples of how I use markdown in preparing for classes, [The Mise en Place for University Class Preparation](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/08/the-mise-en-place-for-university-class-preparation/) and a bit of the why I use Markdown in a post I wrote: [Review of David Sparks's Markdown Book an Investigation to Formatting Documents](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2014/3/review-of-david-sparkss-markdown-book-an-investigation-to-formatting-documents).

I will post the presentation as we get closer to class next week.
