## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week four, we move away from talking about groups in general and discussing a specific type of group, that of working with families. Students are expected to read Chovil (2009). We will also be talking about the dimensions of family assessment. These include (1) Homeostasis, (2) Boundaries and Boundary Maintenance, (3) Family Decision Making, Hierarchy, and Power, (4) Family Roles, (5) Communication Styles of Family Members (6) Family Life Cycle, (7) Family Rules, (8) Social Environment, and (9) Family Adaptive Capacity (Stressors and Strengths).

The agenda for this week is as follows:

- Strengths perspective and families
- Engagement and assessment with families

## Unit Resources

You **need to read** Chovil (2009).

During this class session you will need the following:

- Different colored construction paper cut into shapes of various sizes and shapes (any shapes/sizes that you want). We will be creating a simple genogram out of the construction paper and so you will need enough pieces to symbolize the different members of your family (consider immediate or extended and however you define your family). If you are not able to do this, students could also draw the genogram on paper, but the cutout shapes are preferable.

I created an 11-minute video to go with this material. It discusses [Strengths-Based Engagement with Families](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2020/03/strengths-based-engagement-with-families-youtube-video/). It provides some specifics for how we can think about strengths perspective and working with families and groups.
