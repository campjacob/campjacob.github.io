You all have made it. I have made it! We are having joined potluck on Wednesday starting at 5:30. It will be fun. Feel free to bring some games or activities we can do, and you can share what food you are bringing on the Google Doc [SOWK 460 and 487 End of The Year Potluck](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Qt0JzwQBIv9Y-krs5qYyH8WVlfcuJ82qH3gMECstHA/edit?usp=sharing).

I'm still making my way through grading. I won't be finished grading your research papers (and extra credit) until at least this weekend. I should have the rest all finalized sooner.

If you haven't completed the [SOWK 487W Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=80D1DC0A-3F3A-4F42-AE34-3F64A45A24E3&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=T0JQU9C327) to give me feedback about this course, please do so. I will see you all tomorrow.

Final grades must be submitted by instructor no later than Wednesday (05/15/24) by 5:00 PM.
