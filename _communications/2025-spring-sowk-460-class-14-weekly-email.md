## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 14 is the last regular in-person class of the semester. Next week, students will work on their papers and presentations. This week, we look into how we interpret and write about findings. We will look at academic writing and how to use the APA style guide to use bias-free language, write an abstract, and more. We will be going over the total sections of the final paper. We will also have time for you to work in your groups on your final assignments.

The agenda is as follows:

- Reviewing the executive summary
- Writing the abstract
- Discussion starters
- Bias-free language
- Telling a story with your data
- Writing a summary with data from last week
- Time to work with your group
