## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 14 for SOWK 591 is synchronous, with class on Saturday (04/26/25). Students will reflect on their practicum experience in their journals. During class, we will have a student-led discussion regarding professional development, engage in mindfulness through mindful movement, participate in a group reflecting on their practice, and complete end of year evaluations. The following is the agenda:

- SLED: Continued Development (Professional and Self) 
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group
- End of semester evaluation

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will provide feedback to help guide this course.
- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider continued development and its application to practice.
