I'm still working on the presentation and specifics for class tomorrow. I'll upload things before. You will have some time to work on your final papers/presentations during class. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 14 is the last regular in-person class of the semester. Next week, students will work on their papers and presentations. This week, we look into how we interpret and write about findings. We will look at academic writing and how to use the APA style guide to use bias-free language, write an abstract, and more. We will be going over the total sections of the final paper. We will also have time for you to work in your groups on your final assignments.
