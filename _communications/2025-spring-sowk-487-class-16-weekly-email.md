Remember, no in-person class this week. I'll see you guy's next week.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 16 is the final week of class and will be facilitated through a video lecture. We will be reviewing evaluations within group work. My dissertation, Campbell (2023), was based on participatory action research (PAR). I provide McDonald (2012) as a primer for doing PAR as a social work group research methodology. During week 15, we look at Community-Based Participatory Research Partnerships (CBPR) in the context of best practices for working with groups. The reading in Teufel-Shone et al. (2018) provides more of an understanding of what these groups look like, especially from the context of a group. The following are the topics for this session.

The agenda for this week is as follows:

- Evaluation designs for groups
- Difference between program evaluation and clinical evaluation
- What is a qualitative design methodology
- Participatory Action Research

**A-04c: Facilitation Reflective Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 100 pts (20% of final grade); _Deadline_ Monday 05/12/25 8:00 AM _Completion_ via an upload in assignments on MyHeritage; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2425_SP-SOWK_487W-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=41ff1f48-e2a1-41a9-a21b-9375777f66eb) and [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=27b852f4-09ad-448c-ad0a-63ea805654f5).

**Purpose**: Reflecting on an experience can be valuable in demonstrating learning and increasing critical thinking skills.

**Task**: Students will write a reflective paper discussing their experience facilitating the group. The reflections do not need to discuss other members' performance or activity. Reflective essays should still follow a research paper's page formatting and tone but should use first-person voice.

**Success**: Students will submit a paper that reflects on their experience. See _Appendix B Reflective Paper Rubric_. The document should be 500-750 words in length. Students should submit the paper on time, have good grammar, and be professionally formatted.

# Appendix B Reflective Paper Rubric

**Assignments 06 [Extra Credit]: Group Work and Cultural Competency Opportunities**

The faculty for this course offers students two different opportunities for extra credit during this course. The first is a minor assignment for attending a therapeutic or task group and drafting a reflective paper regarding the experience. The second is a more intensive research paper looking into culturally competent practices in social work.

**A-06a: Group Participation and Reflective Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 25 extra credit points (5% of final grade); _Deadline_ Monday 05/12/25 at 08:00 AM; _Completion_ submission via assignments on MyHeritage; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2425_SP-SOWK_487W-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=29a405c7-cd2d-42bf-8ee0-8b28a3058132) and [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=38b0413f-11d1-4a05-829a-3bf677b77c5c).

**Purpose**: Offer students an assignment to earn extra credit points where they can reflect on participation in a group and the experience through the lens of social work.

**Task**: The student would participate in a therapeutic or task group and write about their experience. The group would attend an AA meeting or something similar offered in the community. It can also be a task group, especially a policy-related group (such as a school board meeting). After attending and observing the group, the student would write a short reflective paper.

**Success**: The reflective paper will be approximately 500 to 750 words. For more information, see _Appendix B Reflective Paper Rubric_.

**Purpose**: Offer students an assignment to earn more extra credit points where they delve further into evidence-based practices and literature related to cultural competence.

**Task**: This paper reviews evidence-based cultural competency practices for social workers. Students may choose from any cultural practice on which to base their research (examples could range from how social workers use eye contact in working with clients to best practices for working with a Muslim client). However, the paper will generally describe the following:

- Description of the evidence-based practice being reviewed
- Review of the evidence presented in scholarly sources regarding the practice
- Implications the practice has for social work or practitioners
- Strengths and limitations of the practice

**Success**: The paper should be written in APA format using strong academic writing and proper formatting. See _Appendix D APA Research Paper Rubric_ for more information. The report should be approximately 1,250 to 1,500 words in length. This paper will be graded according to the APA research paper rubric.

**APA Research Paper Rubric**

The APA Research Paper Rubric evaluates assignments based on content, organization, APA formatting, and professionalism. Content is assessed for relevance, adherence to syllabus topics, and the use of credible sources to develop arguments. The organization focuses on logical flow, smooth transitions, and compelling writing. APA formatting is evaluated in tone, page layout, reference lists, and in-text citations, with high standards for proper style and accuracy. Professionalism includes attention to grammar, spelling, timeliness, and adherence to word length requirements.
