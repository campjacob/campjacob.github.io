I hope that you all had a great long weekend with labor day. I'm looking forward to class this Wednesday. One of the things that we will be talking about this week around roles and fields of practice for social workers. Last year, I made a video [The 15 Hats (ahem, Roles) of Social Workers](https://youtu.be/iBmtlNkEnFI) or see [my blog post about it](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/02/the-15-hats-ahem-roles-of-social-workers/). Not only do you get to see me put on literally 15 different hats, I talk a little about each of the different roles we take on in it.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. Don't forget to complete the reading quiz found on the MyHeritage class forum. This week the reading is:

- Hepworth et al. (2017) __Chapters 1 & 2__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- How we help
- Evidence-based practice
- Involuntary clients
- Ecological Systems Model
- Social work jobs and roles

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
