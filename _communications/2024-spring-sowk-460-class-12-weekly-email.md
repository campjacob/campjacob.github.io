## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

The focus of week 12 is on how to share the information for your program evaluation. What we do with the data we collect and how we present that information to the stakeholders is a crucial aspect of program evaluation. Students will learn some strategies for how evaluations are disseminated.

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Kapp and Anderson (2010) Chapter 13

**A-01: Class Engagement and Attendance**

We are doing class asynchronously this week. It is a great time to make progress on your program evaluation, especially as the week's topic is related to dissemination. 


The forums for this asynchronous week are based on the textbook. There are several discussion prompts at the end of the chapter. In the forum [Discussion Prompts from Textbook](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2324_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-12_41_-_47.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=7ce9b8f6-5a53-4b30-8f75-ab657b4d3071), students can choose any of the prompts to respond to. You are to make at least two replies in this forum. Replies can be to the prompt or to a peer; just make sure your replies are substantial and additive.

**A-02: Chapter Reading Quizzes**

This is the final reading quiz of the semester (maybe your BASW program). There is only one question, as you have answered the other 49 earlier in the semester. You can find [W-12 A-02 for Kapp and Anderson (2010) chapter 13](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2324_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=TestBuilderView&screenType=change&id=4b823757-ccc5-4090-a295-aed5c1ebf8dc) by Sunday 04/07. 

**A-04a Individual Weekly Journal Entries**

You can find the assignment [W-12 A-04a Journal Entry 07](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2324_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=next&id=1f97fd10-3379-41e0-82ad-4139ad4d42ab).


## Unit Resources

The [Federal Evaluation Toolkit^beta](https://www.evaluation.gov/evaluation-toolkit/promoting-evaluation/) provides helpful resources for students to review. The [How to Communicate Findings from a Program Evaluation](https://www.evaluation.gov/assets/resources/Resource_Communication%20Guide%20for%20TTCW%20Grantees%20-%20What%20to%20Consider%20When%20Sharing%20Program%20Accomplishments.pdf) gives valuable ideas for how to communicate findings with lots of ideas and examples. I would encourage students to skim through it. The other resources also provide some excellent insight into program evaluation.
