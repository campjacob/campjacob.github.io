I hope you are all doing well! I have the forums all posted for this week (week 04) in MyHeritage. I haven't recorded my lecture video yet, but I will here by this evening. Something I was thinking about, is if people wanted to do some sort of movie watch party (see the doing an MSE below on a character in a movie forum), I could try to plan something for (probably would be Friday early evening) via Zoom. If there are a number of people interested let me know and I will set it up (just tell me if you are).


## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week four, we are delving into the work of assessment. This week is asynchronous, so there are no in-person class sessions. Students will be reading the textbook with content related to biopsychosocial assessments, engaging in forums related to that, developing a consent form, the types of content and questions used in assessment, and developing a diagnosis and/or mental status examination.

The Learning Objectives for this week include:

- Students will be able to identify the common categories for biopsychosocial assessments and what information clinicians generally gather in those sessions.
- Students will be able to develop an initial draft of the informed consent form they will use for their case study paper.
- Students will practice assessing for a mental status examination.

## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Read Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 3
- Watch my lecture video (coming by end of the day 09/09/24)

**Weekly Online Discussion Forums**

This week, there are four discussion forums for you to engage in. I want you to make a total of **six replies**. I want at least four of your replies to any prompts across the forums. The other two replies can focus more on dialog with peers or giving feedback. Especially consider potential feedback related to developing your informed consent form and questions you might use in the assessment. The following is a brief overview of the forums for this week:

After reading the textbook, students can engage in [chapter 03 reflection questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_99_-_915.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=b09760dc-eeac-459f-b737-3de985fc0f0f) to explore how clinicians use diagnostic reasoning and therapeutic practices.
- In starting to look more at your case study paper (and the biopsychosocial assessment you will be doing), students have a space to [develop a consent form for the case study paper](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_99_-_915.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=2cdf839c-4308-45f8-952a-095154951e9f).
- In considering biopsychosocial assessments, reviewing what a clinician evaluates for and what questions they ask during an assessment is helpful. In the forum, [questions used and content evaluated in developing a biopsychosocial assessment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_99_-_915.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=8b928533-5715-421e-834b-cfd48e0e34f9), students have the opportunity to share their ideas.
- Mental status examinations are complicated and require practice. To consider this, the forum [actor representation of mental health disorder and mental status examination](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_99_-_915.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=88b700d1-1942-49b0-a778-bb625ce09e08) forum provides a space for students to practice both evaluating this based off of a movie.

You are expected to read all the posts across all the forums. Your forums are due before Monday (09/16 at 8 AM).

**Reading Quizzes**

Complete [W-04 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 03](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=8edc9e1a-0e81-4e1a-9c4d-0e0685715328) by 8 AM on Monday 09/16.


## Unit Resources

In the forums, I provide a number of resources that might be helpful in discussing some of the topics. PsychDB (2024a and 2024b) provide good resources for [Mental Status Exam (MSE)](https://www.psychdb.com/teaching/mental-status-exam-mse) and the [Psychiatric Interview](https://www.psychdb.com/teaching/1-psych-interview). I am uploading a chapter by Renn and John (2019) that is uploaded as a handout. It is not required reading, but could be helpful in going deeper into the understanding mental status examinations.

In looking at consent, the forum includes a number of resources that could be helpful. Make sure to review some of those as you start to develop your consent form.

You can find all of the videos for this course in [Lecture Videos](). You can find [Fall 2024 SOWK 581 (0) - Week 04]().
