## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Being able to effectively collaborate is a vital skill in school social work. Week five of SOWK 587 is a synchronous week, with in-person class on Saturday (02/21/26). Students will read about collaboration in their textbook (Jarolmen & Batista-Thomas, 2023) and have opportunities to engage in with other sources exploring how we work together in schools. In discussion forums, students will share real-world examples of collaboration and engage critically with the material. During class, we will build on these discussions by practicing key collaboration techniques in simulated team settings.

The agenda for class is as follows:

- Multi-disciplinary team meetings
- Best practices and strategies for effective collaboration
- MTDM Role-Play Scenarios
- Intersectionality and working with diverse team members

The Learning Objectives for the week include

- Critically reflect on the experiences of effective collaboration to draw out common elements
- Analyze the topic of collaboration from a number of different perspectives and focuses 
- Identify practices that are effective working in teams and strategies for implementing them
- Assess methods to develop rapport and work with diverse team members
- Implement a collaborative meeting using active listening, shared decision-making, and conflict resolution skills

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are _four forums_ for this week, and you are expected to make at least **3 replies** across any of the forums and read all of your peers' replies. These forums include the following:

- Examples of effective teamwork are examined in [Reflection on Examples of Collaboration](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/🏫_W-05_216-222.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=8b630b67-f296-4108-bc3b-4f33336df133), where students analyze what makes collaboration successful and how it supports student learning outcomes.
- The [Week Five Reading and Podcast Engagement Discussion](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/🏫_W-05_216-222.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=b2192535-a05a-411b-ad18-51221dac60e3) allows students to connect with the material shared this week.
- Practical school-based scenarios are explored through the [Chapter Five Textbook Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/🏫_W-05_216-222.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=2d749837-c793-4ad7-8a7f-e021793d66ee), prompting reflection on professional identity, safety, referral processes, and culturally responsive engagement.
- The forum for [Questions about A-02 Ethical Decision-Making Video Presentations](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/🏫_W-05_216-222.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=2c9e02ae-9566-4718-b113-43e1c73d2351) provides a space for clarifying expectations and preparing for the upcoming ethical decision-making assignment.


## Unit Resources

Your Assignment 2 - Ethical Decision-Making Video Presentation (see [Syllabus Handout with Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=5c9657fc-c752-4b66-8df9-6e884e3fea8a)) is due next week. You can post any questions you might have, and I will attempt to answer them so everybody can read them in the forum [Questions about A-02 Ethical Decision-Making Video Presentations](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2526_SP-SOWK_587-0/🏫_W-05_216-222.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=2c9e02ae-9566-4718-b113-43e1c73d2351).

I'm asking you all to read some of the legal codes defining school social workers. First in, in the state definition of certifications, they differentiate between school psychologists and social workers ([School psychologists and social workers - Domains and roles, RCW 28A.410.044](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.410.044), 2018). The laws that lay out expectations of districts also include two sections that guide school social counselors, psychologists and social workers and what their [priorities](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.320.280) as professions are in schools and expectations on [professional collaboration](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.320.290) (Priorities, RCW 28A.320.280, 2018; Professional collaboration, RCW 28A.320.290, 2018)). 

As discussed over the last couple of weeks, a multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) and response to intervention (RTI) are essential place for social collaboration. Avant and Swerdlik (2016) provide examples of this collaboration. 

Coordinating and collaborating with families is another important aspect of our work. Lefkowitz et al. (2020) explore coordination and communication through family engagement and equity. It is a good episode. You can find the podcast posted on their website [S5E22 – Family Engagement and Equity](https://integratedschools.org/podcast/ishimaru/) or [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/family-engagement-and-equity/id1440625690?i=1000493909530), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Oh9EuyiWv3gJ3bQfODa2x), or [Overcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Oh9EuyiWv3gJ3bQfODa2x).

During class, we will use a couple of handouts. These include [Skills We Need to Be Eﬀective Collaborators - A-Z](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=5a7aca69-b48b-49b7-8430-5bafd2fa9be4) and [MTDM Role-Play Scenarios](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=f5dc4beb-1617-4379-affe-2f687ee27994)
