A few reminders. Please complete the [course evaluation](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=4DE9B1BA-A605-48C6-A10E-5BF26DA38F60&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=10LHTR2307). Also add what you are thinking about bringing to the [Fall 2024 SOWK 486w Celebration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWpeYEC6HuPEVCz6OJnVc3urG2KZP0co29O0GFw7GOI/edit?usp=sharing) that is next week instead of a final. I'm sure there will be enough if you aren't able to bring anything it won't be a problem. I'm still working my way through grading your videos. If you saw your grade change yesterday it should be fixed now as I configured one of the extra credit assignment to not be worth only extra credit. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

You have made it to the end of this class, as week 15 is our final session. Assessments are an essential aspect of social work and direct practice with clients. We should be participating in assessments of our practice and the interventions that we complete with clients. There are many ways to go through that. The schedule for today is to look at the following:

-  Evaluation
-  The evaluation process
-  Termination
-  Follow up
-  Self Care

**Assignment 04: Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play and Reflection Paper**

Worth 200 points, or 50% of the student's final grade, the assignment has two parts, each worth 100 points. The _Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play_ is a key assignment[^1] for the social work program. This assignment allows you to view yourself as a social worker conducting an interview. The _Interviewing Skills Reflection Paper_ provides a space to self-critique your engagement and interviewing skills.

[^1]: Heritage University's social work program selects assignments across the curriculum for students to demonstrate each of the practice behaviors defined by the CSWE to act as key assignments. These assignments are submitted to Heritage's online portfolio, Anthology Portfolio, and given to all students at each site using the same grading rubric. Student scores help provide data for faculty to self-evaluate the program.

**_Assignment 04b: Interviewing Skills Reflective Paper_**

**Meta**:  Points 100 pts (25% of student's final grade); Deadline Monday 12/09/24 at 08:00 AM; Submission via Assignments section of My Heritage. Locations [MyHeritage Assignment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2425_FA-SOWK_486W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=3294a0d7-7a73-41aa-b897-6e853d3393bf), [Syllabus Assignment Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=b04e5e6f-6e03-4d5e-b4a1-99a6d964e051)

**Purpose**:  The _Interviewing Skills Reflective Paper_ offers students a chance to reflect on the experience of their role-play after having watched themselves using a critical eye, increasing students' self-reflection.

**Task**:  After students have completed their role-play and had an opportunity to review their performance, they will individually author a reflective paper describing their experience and what they learned. The reflection should be between 500 and 750 words long, formatted using the APA 7th edition style guide. Abstracts are optional, and if your paper does not cite any sources, there is no need for a reference page. Students must include the following in their writing:

· **Areas of Strengths**: The paper should discuss your areas of strength demonstrated in the role-play. For example, "I used attentive body language because I leaned in slightly and maintained eye contact." Be specific about what went well. Include quotes from either party.

· **Areas for Improvement**: The paper should also discuss your areas for improvement. Again, be specific and use concrete language. State how you will work on these skills.

**Success**:  Students will submit a paper demonstrating their ability to self-reflect and write using strong academic writing skills. Grades are assigned based on the _Reflective Paper Rubric_. Feedback from the instructor will be completed by final Grades, due Wednesday, 12/18/24, at 5:00 PM.

**_Reflective Paper Rubric_**

The _Reflective Paper Rubric_ is used to evaluate written reflective-style papers. The rubric assesses students based on the following aspects: paper content, professionalism, spelling, grammar, timeliness, and length. The following assignments in this course will be graded according to the reflective paper rubric: _A-04b – Video Role Reflective Paper_ and A-_05a – Empathetic Communication Self-Evaluation Reflective Paper_.

## Unit Resources

Hepworth et al. (2022) discuss outcome and session rating scales. There is some good discussion on the Social Work Podcast about how this can be implemented by Singer (2021). It is a good episode. You can find it at [the website](https://socialworkpodcast.blogspot.com/2021/12/FIT.html), on [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+Hdsrb4QA), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/131-feedback-informed-treatment-interview-with-scott-d/id216662405?i=1000545326119), or [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zb2NpYWx3b3JrcG9kY2FzdC5jb20vc29jaWFsd29ya3BvZGNhc3QueG1s/episode/aHR0cHM6Ly9zb2NpYWx3b3JrcG9kY2FzdC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi9GSVQuaHRtbA?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwiw1ObzruOCAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ).

We are talking about assessment in class this week. It is also time for the evaluation of the class. I do value feedback. The results of the survey tool are confidential, so I don't receive any names related to specific responses. You should have a spot to take the evaluation on the sidebar or [CourseEval](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=4DE9B1BA-A605-48C6-A10E-5BF26DA38F60&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=10LHTR2307).

For finals week, we are not having a test but are having a celebration. It will take place next Wednesday (12/11/22) at 5:30 in SWL 104 for an end-of-semester celebration. I created a Google Doc for planning - [Fall 2024 SOWK 486w Celebration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWpeYEC6HuPEVCz6OJnVc3urG2KZP0co29O0GFw7GOI/edit?usp=sharing).

The presentation will be uploaded

You can find the recording of all of our classes in the [lecture videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2425_FA-SOWK_486W-1/Lecture_Videos.jnz) for this course. You can find `[Fall 2024 SOWK 486w 1 - Week 15]()`.
