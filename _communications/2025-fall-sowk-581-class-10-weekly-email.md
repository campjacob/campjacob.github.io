## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week ten is a synchronous week, with class on 11/01. The readings will be about cognitive theory. Further description and slides to come.

## Unit Assignments

**Reading**

- Read Cooper and Granucci Lesser's (2022) Chapter 9 _Cognitive Theory: A Structural Approach_

**W-10 A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are three forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- The [reflection questions for chapter nine](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-10_1027-112.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=7e2ad9a0-02ba-4912-a38d-304ef9c4d414) explore the case study.. Students can consider her irrational thoughts and schemas, some considerations for how you could help her dispute her thoughts, what positive psychology could add to the case, and what role the relationship has.
- The [reflection on your own thoughts](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-10_1027-112.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=a408fdda-4027-4f9f-b8c8-0571a55f2672) forum  asks students to spend time documenting their thoughts and feelings in a log and share about the impact doing a task has on themselves.
- The forum on [considering dysfunctional thinking](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-10_1027-112.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=81537667-1e60-4104-8e52-62e49d5c143b) offers space for students to consider how we explore client experiences for dysfunctional thinking and what examples we might find in practice.

**Reading Quizzes**

[W-11 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 09](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=5b57ad7b-13d3-4ac9-8f3a-9ed1d38e9d6a) is due no later than Saturday 11/1, 8:00 AM.

**A-04b: Intervention Plan Presentation**

After pushing your assessments to be due later, I will add an additional week for your intervention plan video

## Unit Resources

You can see a handout for [Distorted Thinking Error Cards](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=3f7a588b-b9a6-4479-be90-480ef43cbf7e) attached as a resource for this week for an in-class activity we will do. Another resource that I share about during class is the Harborview Abuse & Trauma Center has their [CBT + NOTEBOOK](https://depts.washington.edu/uwhatc/cbt-notebook/). This is a fabulous resource and I recommend reviewing it.
