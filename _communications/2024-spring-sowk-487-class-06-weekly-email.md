I hope you are all doing well and had a good three day weekend. I'm looking forward to class this week. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week six, we are transitioning from working with families to working just with groups for the rest of the semester. Reading Hepworth et al. (2022) and Chapter 11: Understanding Social Work Groups provides a strong understanding of the various types of groups that we will be talking about for the rest of the semester. The agenda is as follows:

- Practice with a development group
- Overview of working with groups
- Group dynamics and roles
- Working in a circle activity
