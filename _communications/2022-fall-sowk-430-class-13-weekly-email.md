Another great social work focused podcast is [_In Social Work_](https://www.insocialwork.org), from the University of Buffalo. This episode isn't on the current iteration of their podcast, and is actually from when they called their show "Living Proof." I had thought they weren't active anymore, but their feed changed about a year ago. You can scroll through their archives and see a number of great episodes. This episode only available on their website. You should check out the current iteration of the podcast and subscribe if you are interested. You can find it on [Apple Podcast App](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/insocialwork/id1587709652) or the [Google Podcast App](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zb2NpYWx3b3JrLm9yZy9mZWVkL3BvZGNhc3Q). The episode I'm having you listen to this week was published in 2008 by Sobota, which is titled "Episode 5 - Dr. Lawrence Shulman: Models of Supervision: Parallel Processes and Honest Relationships."
