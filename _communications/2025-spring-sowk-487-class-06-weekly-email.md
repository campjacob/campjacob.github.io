I hope that you all are doing well. I'm excited to to move into focusing on group work.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week six, we are transitioning from working with families to working with groups for the rest of the semester. Reading Hepworth et al.

This session is designed to help orient us to group work, dynamics, and general processes. The agenda is as follows:

- Overview of working with groups
