Tonight is the last night of class. I look forward to seeing all of you in a couple of hours.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 16 is the final week of class. We will be reviewing evaluations within group work. The readings for the week include Gant (2017), who helps to describe further what evaluations are for groups. This class session serves as a primer for the second-year BASW program that dives further into research methods. The majority of research methods that look into group work follow a qualitative design method. Preston et al. (2017) help explain some of the methodologies within qualitative research. Finally, Macgowan (2017) explains a specific type of group research design related to intervention research.

The agenda for this week is as follows:

- Evaluation designs for groups
- Difference between program evaluation and clinical evaluation
- What is a qualitative design methodology
- Intervention research

**Task**: Students should go to [Course Evaluations](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/CoursEval.jnz) and complete their evaluation.

**Criterion for Success**: It is assumed that all students have completed this assignment.

### A-04: Research Paper to Inform Group Practice

**Meta**: Points 100 pts (25% of final grade); Deadline Friday <span style="color:red;text-decoration: line-through;">04/23/21</span> 04/30/21 at 11:55 PM; Completion Submit an individual paper via My Heritage Assignments which is connected to Chalk and Wire

**Purpose**: The Research Paper to Inform Group Practice is used as a Key Assignment for SOWK 487. Research regarding what makes services effective is constantly being conducted. However, social workers in generalist practice don’t always utilize the research to enhance the services they provide. The purpose of this assignment is to learn to apply knowledge gained by reading peer-reviewed journal articles and other quality sources of information.

The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE, 2015) describes nine different competency areas for social work students. This assignment is designed to offer students the opportunity to demonstrate competency in subsections of two of these areas of competency. The first one is competency four, which states “Engage In Practice-informed Research and Research-informed Practice” (p. 8). Specifically, it will look at and evaluate the student’s ability to “use and translate research evidence to inform and improve practice, policy, and service delivery” (p. 8). The assignment will also be used to review the student’s ability to “Intervene with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and Communities” (p. 9), which is the eighth competency described by the CSWE. The distinct practice behavior in examining interventions students will be assessed according to their ability to “apply knowledge of human behavior and the social environment, person-in-environment, and other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks in interventions with clients and constituencies” (p. 9).

**Task**: Working individually, students will complete a research paper regarding a facilitated treatment group. It is helpful for the student to select a group that they might be interested in providing in the future. The group can be on almost any topic. For instance, you may choose to research chemical dependency, sex offender treatment, sexual abuse recovery, grief and loss, parenting children with special needs, homeless teens, etc. The final paper will be 1,500 to 1,750 words in length. It should be written using APA format and strong academic and professional writing skills. A title page, abstract, written article, and reference page are all to be included. The paper will include a minimum of four sources that provide guidance for facilitating your group topic. At least two articles must be from peer-reviewed sources.

The final paper should include the following information:

- Discussion, synthesis, and analysis of the findings of the research
- Examination how the research findings relate to each other, it is helpful to look for themes in the articles and base your paper around those themes
- Use of examples about how the information provided should be applied to practice with groups
- Understanding of how to apply the information to the knowledge of human behavior and the social environment, person-in-environment, and other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks in interventions with clients and constituencies

**Criterion for Success**: This paper will be graded according to the Research and Intervention Practice Behavior Rubric and the APA Research Paper Rubric. The competencies will be assessed through the Practice Behaviors Rubric.
