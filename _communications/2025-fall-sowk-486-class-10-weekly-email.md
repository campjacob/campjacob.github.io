I hope you all have had a good couple of weeks. My conference went great and I am looking forward to seeing everybody on Wednesday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Planning is an integral part of working with clients. After we have assessed their needs, we need to help develop goals for our clients to work on as we move into the intervention stage of the planned change process. Students will read two chapters from Hepworth et al. (2023) focused on developing goals and the types of interventions we might choose to engage our clients in. During class, we will explore goal-setting and goal-creation. The following is the agenda for the class session.

- Course content discussion (feedback, papers, and upcoming assignment)
- Information about goals
- The six steps to planning
- Practice doing the planning process

The learning objectives this week include:

- Explain the purpose, function, and types of goals used in social work practice.
- Apply the six-step planning process to develop goals collaboratively.
