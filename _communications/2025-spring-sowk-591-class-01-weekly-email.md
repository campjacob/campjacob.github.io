I hope that you all had a great break and are excited to be for this semester. Let me know if there is anything you need and I will see you all on Saturday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

The advanced seminar two a continuation of SOWK 590 from last semester. It is an opportunity to reflect on your learning from your practicum placement. In this first session, we will check in with review updates to the practicum manual and the course syllabus for the spring semester. We will do a mindfulness activity focused on setting intention for the semester and check in with how people's practicum is going.

During our in-person session, the following is the agenda:

- Review Updated Practicum Manual and Syllabus
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice setting intention, an important aspect of mindfulness.
