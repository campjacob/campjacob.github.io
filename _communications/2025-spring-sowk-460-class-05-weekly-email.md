Have a wonderful week and see you week six!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

SOWK 460 week five is asynchronous, with no in-person class. You will read chapter seven from Royse (2023), which is focused on the range of experimental design methods that can be used to group participants in research. These include experimental, quasi-experimental, and pre-experimental design methods, as well as some random sampling discussion. In my lecture video, we will discuss writing about an ethical framework and how that can be applied to your final paper and research design. I also ask you to read McDonald et al. (2015) and their discussion of how to write about ethical frameworks in social work. 

The agenda for the video includes:

- Expectations for week five
- What is an ethical framework
- Ways we consider ethics within program evaluation
- How we would write about ethical frameworks
