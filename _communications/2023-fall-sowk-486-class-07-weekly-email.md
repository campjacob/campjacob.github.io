## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week seven and the topic of counterproductive communication builds on week six, which generally looks at just skills related to communication. Communication happens all of the time, and through both verbal and nonverbal patterns. As social workers, we have an obligation to look at how we are communicating and make an attempt to not be putting up barriers to have communication flow freely. The agenda for class this week is as follows:

- Parts and best practices of verbal and nonverbal communication 
- Reflective responding
- Barriers to communication

**Assignment 03: Theory and Practice Integrative Paper**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 100 pts (25% of final grade); _Deadline_ Friday 10/06/23 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ via My Heritage Assignments as an uploaded paper. [Submission Location](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2324_FA-SOWK_486W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=49225284-d567-4857-b8a9-148cdfd884af) and [PDF Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=3395c2b4-f9d5-4ff5-94ac-84d0b202441b)

**Purpose**:  Students show the integration of theories of practice into their real-world implementation through the assigned _Theory and Practice Integrative Paper_. Students work with a partner to describe an interprofessional conceptual framework, a fictional client, and the implementation of direct practice with a client using the framework. 

**Task**:  Working in groups of two, students will author a paper describing a theory of practice and how a practitioner would implement it working with an individual client. Students may choose any interprofessional conceptual framework related to social work they want to discuss. Hepworth et al. (2022) provide the orienting frameworks for social, including ecosystems perspective, strengths perspective, cultural humility, anti-oppressive practices, trauma-informed care, and evidence-based practices. Other notable examples include the feminist perspective, developmental theories, and other theories described in human behavior and the social environment. Students can approach this project with creativity in how they portray the information, but it must consist of the following minimum parts:

- APA formatting in strong academic writing (e.g., tone, word choice, writing perspective), paper style (paper sections, headers and footers, page layout, and spacing), and citations (in-text citation and reference list)
- Description of the theory examined using peer-reviewed academic journal articles (must use both in-text citations and a reference list)
- Discussion of a fictional client and their circumstances
- Application of the theory to direct practice actions a clinician would use

**Success**: Successful papers are evaluated using the _APA Research Paper Rubric,_ which includes assessing the paper content, APA formatting, spelling, grammar, timeliness, and length. Each paper should be between 1,250 and 1,500 words in length. Feedback from the instructor will be completed no later than mid-term grades due by the faculty on 10/18/23 at 5:00 PM.
