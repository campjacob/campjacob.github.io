## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 14 invites us to reflect inwardly and outwardly. There are a few discussion forums that students can engage in to explore personal and professional development, the power of practicing gratitude, and the complex meanings holidays hold across diverse communities.

The learning objectives I have this week include

- Reflect on your personal and professional development.
- Identify and articulate practices of gratitude and their relevance to well-being and resilience.
- Critically examine the cultural and historical meanings of holidays.
