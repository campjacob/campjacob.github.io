I hope that you are all doing well. I am starting to feel a bit better, but I have been pretty out sick all week.

## What You Will Learn for Week 03

In week three we continue to learn about the disability rights movement in the United States. Students have a reading quiz about the American's with Disabilities Act (ADA). In the lecture video for this week, students will also have the opportunity to learn about legislation such as ADA and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) mean for schools. The following are the learning objectives for this week.

- Develop an understanding of the modern disability rights movement
- Demonstrate knowledge of some key components of the Americans with Disabilities Act
- Learn about some of the experience persons starting in the disability rights movement in the United States
- Hear information about what some of the laws mean in practice for students in K-12 settings


## Unit Resources

This week, you will be doing [A-02: Disability Rights Quiz](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=475f4cb2-14eb-46c4-9b93-dde39fabdce1), which is all about the American with Disabilities Act (ADA, 1990). Mid-Atlantic ADA Center (n.d.) has a two-page, very brief and concise handout that includes all of the information you need to pass the quiz. The handout is [An Overview of the Americans with Disabilities Act](https://adata.org/sites/adata.org/files/files/ADA_Overview_2015-handout.pdf). Netflix Film Club (2020) has a good film that talks about ADA law, [How the ADA Changed the Built World | Crip Camp | Netflix](https://youtu.be/5aiFVhXSvgc) that is good.

While the chapter does not talk much about the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 2004), as chapter four, Disability Legislation and the ADA in Rothman (2018), talks more about this. As we move into week four, we will be moving away from legislation, so we won't be reading this chapter. As many social worker positions that interact with persons with disabilities are related to schools, I wanted to make sure that you are also exposed to that. My lecture video, [SOWK 322 Week 03 - Special Education Services in Schools](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=62716fc8-513b-4865-bc6d-ae2c016a36a1) is focused on understanding how special education services work within a school setting. It examines the following:

- General overview of special education
- Referral process for special services
- Positions and rolls

You can see just the slides for all my classes at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>, and specifically for [SOWK 322 Week 03 - Special Education Services in Schools](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/009mni).

My presentation helps identify how schools implement ADA and IDEA and how professionals outside of school can coordinate with schools. For more information about IDEA, The American Institutes for Research (2015) provides a good short history and reasoning behind IDEA in their video, [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: 40 Years Later](https://youtu.be/rgwstMsPvd4)

Finally, as I read the Rothman (2018) chapter three, I was blown away hearing about Ed Roberts and the change and impact he had on persons with disabilities to pursue higher education. He was a significant force in the independent living movement. I wanted to hear more about him and came across Research & Training Center on Independent Living (2014), and their video [Ed Roberts: His Words, His Vision](https://youtu.be/ivaJsJ-mnm8) that I think is interesting to watch and learn more about how he saw the need to make changes to the world.
