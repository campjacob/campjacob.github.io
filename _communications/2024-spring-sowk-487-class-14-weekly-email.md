I hope that you all had a good week. Here is the information for this week. I'm planning on going out of town this weekend, so I won't get to start grading your papers until after the weekend, so I'm pushing back the deadline for you all until Sunday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 14 is focused on group work with youth in a school-based setting. One significant function social workers can have in school is assisting with instruction and acquiring social and emotional learning (SEL) skills. Jones et al. (2021) is an in-depth report on SEL in school and can provide insight into what it is. In addition, social workers often lead groups to work on social skills with youth, and Kumm et al. (2021) give a few examples of how we can implement social skill instruction. During class, we will be looking at several ideas. These include the following.

- Overview of Working in Bridges Program
- Overview of SEL
- Implementation of ART Moral Reasoning
- Ideas for Working with Adolescents and Social Skills

You can find [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2324_SP-SOWK_487W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=a2dcf741-8034-46d2-9781-2c7005daef7e) and the [Assignment Page](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=ef0ac182-580e-4d15-94eb-aa163fb88297).

**Purpose**: Research regarding what makes services effective is constantly being conducted. However, social workers in generalist practice don't always utilize research to enhance their services. The purpose of this assignment is to learn to apply knowledge gained by reading peer-reviewed journal articles and other quality sources of information.

**Task**: Working individually, students will complete a research paper regarding a facilitated treatment group. It is helpful for the student to select a group they might be interested in providing in the future. The group can be on almost any topic. For instance, you may choose to research chemical dependency, sex offender treatment, sexual abuse recovery, grief and loss, parenting children with special needs, homeless teens, etc. The final paper will be 1,500 to 1,750 words in length. It should be written using APA format and strong academic and professional writing skills. A title page, abstract, written article, and reference page are all included. The paper will consist of a minimum of four sources that guide facilitating your group topic. At least two journal articles must be from peer-reviewed sources.

The final paper should include the following information:

- Discussion, synthesis, and analysis of the findings of the research
- Examination of how the research findings relate to each other, it is helpful to look for themes in the articles and base your paper around those themes
- Use of examples about how the information provided should be applied to practice with groups
- Understanding of how to apply the information to the knowledge of human behavior and the social environment, person-in-environment, and other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks in interventions with clients and constituencies

**Success**: Students will be assessed on their ability to demonstrate effective scholarly writing and practice behaviors. This paper will be graded according to the research and intervention practice behavior rubric and the APA research paper rubric. In addition, the competencies will be assessed through the practice behaviors rubric. Grades will be included in final grades, which must be submitted by the instructor by Wednesday, 05/15/24 at 5:00 PM. Students can also earn ten extra credit points by demonstrating that they worked with the tutoring services at the Academic Skills Center to review their papers before final submission. Documentation can be emailed to the instructor. 


## Unit Resources

During class we went through and did a session of moral reasoning taken from ART. You can find some of the material used including: The [Form](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=f1c431c3-d2b2-4d97-ad87-0cfa78f8a58a) where data is collected, [Leader Notes for Reggies Problem](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=79ad2043-f4bf-4f70-a829-cfa6da2cbe5c), [Reggies Problem](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=feccffda-0c7d-45ef-9729-f1bba1136817), and [Thinking Errors](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=480504f4-a75c-47fc-8a4a-6ba2b48947dc). The report on SEL by Jones et al. (2021) is lengthy. Students are encouraged to skim this article and maybe pick a section or two that you might read about in it. The engagement question for this article is to just share something that you learned from the article.

We will be talking about social emotional learning as it pertains to using it's development in an educational setting. We watch a short video, [SEL 101: What are the core competencies and key settings](https://youtu.be/ouXhi_CfBVg?si=I7XcFoTGZRv9RScw). We also spend time talking through some of the [competencies describe by CASEL](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/) as the [OSPI resources for SEL](https://ospi.k12.wa.us/student-success/resources-subject-area/social-emotional-learning-sel). Both of are rich resources a great deal of information for somebody doing social work group in a school setting.
