I hope that you are all doing well. I know that there has been a lot going on regarding COVID-19 in the news and updates for community organizations. Heritage has created a page discussing the [Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://www.heritage.edu/coronavirus/) that has information regarding the university response. The following is some relevant information from [Dr. Sund's letter dated March 13](https://heritage.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Presidents-letter-to-students.pdf):

> 1. We will extend spring break through Sunday, March 22, 2020 for undergraduate students. There will be no undergraduate classes the week beginning March 16, 2020.  
> 2. During this time, we expect faculty and students to prepare to continue their programs using available online platforms, making other arrangements for distance learning or other mechanisms, including small group meetings, which maintain social distancing protocols.

I'll be sending out information about a specific plan for the rest of the semester this next week. 

What this means is that I am going to spend this next week determining what we will do for classes until the end of the summer. I would still like you all to complete your journals for this upcoming week (Due Sunday, 03/22/20). There wasn't a Journal entry due for this week. I don't have a reading quiz for you this week. but there will be more in the upcomign weeks.

The class will likely look like some posted videos, potentially some discussion forums, possibly some synchronous class time for the whole class or time with each group through Zoom. I'm assuming that your final presentation will be conducted through PanOpto / Zoom.

I created a form that you can be able to give some feedback about your [preferences for online learning activities](https://forms.gle/raBn11k8C6Vf3U459). I would really appreciate if you spent just a coupel of minutes to complete in the next couple of days so that I can have some feedback as I put together the rest of the semester.

Stay safe, and I will be in contact soon.
