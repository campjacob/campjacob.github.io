Have a great week, and I'll see you all next week. Let me know if I can help with anything.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Ethical practice and program evaluation is the theme for week three of SOWK 460w. This week is asynchronous, so there is no in-person class. Students will complete the CITI research ethics and compliance training. This week's reading from Kapp and Anderson (2010) includes two chapters (three and four), and they are focused on the code of ethics and applying ethical concepts to real-life situations. Students will also complete a reading quiz over those chapters and be able to respond to group discussions via the forums. The learning objectives for this week include the following:

- Demonstrate knowledge of essential human subjects' research topics for social-behavioral-educational researchers.
- Apply the code of ethics to program evaluation
- Understand potential ethical challenges to program evaluation


## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Read Kapp and Anderson's (2010) chapter three _Ethics and Program Evaluation: Applying a Code of Ethics to Field-Based Research_ and chapter four _Ethical Challenges for Evaluators in an Agency Setting: Making Good Choices_.

**A-01: Class Engagement and Attendance**

This week, there are three forums for students to write replies. Two replies are required this week. Replies can be to the prompt in the forum or to one of your peers. Your replies are expected to have enough information to engage in a meaningful discussion and share information/ideas. The following are the forums for week three:

- Along with completing the reading quiz, the forum [Chapter Discussion Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2324_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-03_129_-_24.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=cfa18295-fbaa-464a-9786-6d43d133a8ca) offers questions to delve further into the readings for this week.
- I have published a number of my research papers, and some have [Examples of Informed Consent](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2324_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-03_129_-_24.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=978ab04e-d344-45e9-aea6-f9460f82d6c5).  In this forum, I provide some links to these and offer an opportunity to draw connections to the best practices for informed consent described in your textbook.
- I want students to engage with program evaluation to get a feel for examples of them. In the forum [Published Program Evaluations](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2324_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-03_129_-_24.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=c9de4eb6-cfe2-4d0d-9c1c-cc3b8f17c819), you can find and write a summary of a program evaluation to share with your peers.
