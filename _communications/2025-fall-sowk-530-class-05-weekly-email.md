Have a great week! Let me know if there is anything I can do to support you all.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week five is asynchronous. Students will read chapter eight of Hepworth et al. (2023) and begin our three-week look into the foundations of assessment. There are discussion forums focused on assessing strengths, understanding the sources of information we might use, and assessment instruments. During the lecture video, we will explore more about assessing for strengths and consider what we look for in understanding troubling behavior. The agenda for the lecture video includes:

- Week five content
- Assessing for strengths
- Areas to explore for behavior

The Learning objectives this week include:

- Analyze the purposes, benefits, and limitations of various sources of information used in social work assessments.
- Identify and reflect on practical considerations in using screening tools and structured instruments in clinical practice.
- Develop strategies for emphasizing strengths in assessment
- Understand where strengths fit into our assessment
- Identify the categories we might evaluate for troubling behaviors

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 8 _Exploring and Understanding Problems and Strengths_
- Watch my lecture video

**A-02 W-05 Asynchronous Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are five forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **six replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- In the [Chapter Eight Content Discussion](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/ðŸ’»_W-05_922-928.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=4dffc274-4e11-44df-bf6d-c8f7b48ea0bb), students reflect on the role of assessments in practice, considering topics like diagnostic labels, culturally competent assessments, and the value of theory, observation, and client self-monitoring.
- The [Assessing Strengths Beyond Those Revealed by Clients](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/ðŸ’»_W-05_922-928.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=0ced9e8c-be22-410a-b38e-e30b6d998e11) forum explores how social workers can uncover strengths not explicitly shared by clientsâ€”and when even a "strength" may obscure or complicate the work at hand.
- There are practical upsides and drawbacks of different information we gather within assessment, the forum [Advantages and Limitations of Sources of Information for Assessments](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/ðŸ’»_W-05_922-928.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=d35734df-ac13-4c45-a2e3-b33aeab02e0f) asks students to explore this.
- The [Sources of Information Based on Setting or Population](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/ðŸ’»_W-05_922-928.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=206f6837-325f-4920-b472-14c8735cd17d) forum gives students the opportunity to think through how assessments might vary based on population and setting.
- [Screening Tools and Assessment Instruments](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/ðŸ’»_W-05_922-928.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=b4701295-4d67-4f0c-88ab-2ec2418053a0) are an important setting way that we asses our clients. This forum either asks students to explore related resources and share their findings or to engage in an identified screening tool and reflect on the experience.

**A-03 Reading Quiz**

Complete [W-05 Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 08](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=c2a71803-ae92-4fda-a1f3-72b4e9579807) due by Saturday 9/27, 8:00 AM.
