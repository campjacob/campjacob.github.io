## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

This week is a guest presentation from [Judy Dirks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judy-dirks-4a690237/) about meditation practices.

## Unit Assignments

**A-01: Class Engagement and Participation**

Attend class

**A-04: Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play and Reflection Paper**

Worth 200 points, or 50% of the student's final grade, the assignment has two parts, each worth 100 points. The _Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play_ is a key assignment [^1] for the social work program. This assignment allows you to view yourself as a social worker conducting an interview. The _Interviewing Skills Reflection Paper_ provides a space to self-critique your engagement and interviewing skills.

[^1]: Heritage University's social work program selects assignments across the curriculum for students to demonstrate each of the practice behaviors defined by the CSWE to act as key assignments. These assignments are submitted to Heritage's online portfolio, Anthology Portfolio, and given to all students at each site using the same grading rubric. Student scores help provide data for faculty to self-evaluate the program.

**_A-04a: Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play_**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 100 pts (25% of student's final grade); _Deadline_ Friday 11/17/23 by 11:55 PM; _Completion_ Students submit through Anthology Portfolio ([My Heritage Assignments](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2324_FA-SOWK_486W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=0bf8a01f-7bf9-4cde-bc0f-ca49caf025ac&isLearningToolAssignment=True), [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=db6cd846-5a61-46a6-88a3-d53dfa1404fd), [Appendix D. Compress a Video to Reduce the File Size](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=4bbe35b3-20a4-405c-8b66-5dc9981d0054)). 

**Purpose**:  The Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play supports students in confirming the acquisition of interviewing skills (application of person in the environment, empathetic responding, reflective responding, and other interpersonal skills).

**Task**:  Students will work with a partner to record a 15 to 20-minute interview. The interview should be a role-play of an initial meeting between a social worker and a fictional client. Students have the freedom to develop their settings for the interview. This assignment is designed to offer the student the opportunity to demonstrate engagement, the sixth competency described by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). The following is the language used in the 2022 education and policy standards (EPAS):

> Competency 6: Engage with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and Communities
> 
> Social workers understand that engagement is an ongoing component of the dynamic and interactive process of social work practice with and on behalf of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities.
> 
> Social workers value the importance of human relationships. Social workers understand theories of human behavior and person-in-environment and critically evaluate and apply this knowledge to facilitate engagement with clients and constituencies, including individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Social workers are self-reflective and understand how bias, power, and privilege as well as their personal values and personal experiences may affect their ability to engage effectively with diverse clients and constituencies. Social workers use the principles of interprofessional collaboration to facilitate engagement with clients, constituencies, and other professionals as appropriate.
> 
> Social workers:
> 
> a. apply knowledge of human behavior and person-in-environment, as well as interprofessional conceptual frameworks, to engage with clients and constituencies; and
> 
> b. use empathy, reflection, and interpersonal skills to engage in culturally responsive practice with clients and constituencies. (p. 11)

The following are the instructions for this assignment:

- Students will record a 15 to 20-minute role-play with a classmate. To complete this, students should use a tripod or stable surface to record the role-play with a cell phone or other recording device.
- Each student's role-play will have three parts (1) introduce the role-play setting, (2) complete the client interview using listening and attending skills discussed and practiced in class, and (3) debrief the role-play with your partner.
- The intention is to demonstrate your ability to use attentive listening, open-ended questions, empathetic responding, and other skills. The focus is not on solving the person's problem or difficulties.
- Students can do each of the three parts with the camera rolling. During the debrief with your partner, discuss (a) the things that you said/did that helped the other person feel comfortable and open up, (b) the things that you could have improved, and (c) any suggestions or feedback from your partner.
- After completing the first interview, switch roles and do another 15 to 20-minute role play following the same format.
- Each student should upload their final video of them as the interviewer to Anthology Portfolio for the instructor's assessment.
- Your video may be too large to upload to Anthology Portfolio and need to be compressed. Appendix D provides step-by-step directions with screenshots for how to reduce the file size of your video.

**Success**:  Each student will submit a video of themselves that demonstrates their use of interviewing skills. Grades will be based on the _Engagement Practice Behaviors Rubric_, which evaluates students based on the CSWE competency six. Feedback from the instructor will be completed no later than final Grades, due Wednesday 12/13/23 at 5:00 PM.
