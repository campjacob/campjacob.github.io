## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week 15, we are shifting our focus from treatment to task groups. The readings this week focus on interdisciplinary group work. Bronstein (2003) helps us look into interdisciplinary teamwork and the skills and processes necessary to implement it successfully. Nancarrow et al. (2013) look at the productive aspects of a team. During class, we will do an activity about organizing our priorities and ethics, and a lecture on the learning content for the week.

The agenda includes:

- Prioritizing your values activity
- Conceptual Framework for CBPR groups
- Ethical Dilemmas in Macro Social Work Practice
- Working in teams and multidisciplinary settings
- Energizer activity

The learning objectives for this week include:

- Be able to explain what a Community-Based Participatory Research Partnership is and some of the criteria for how we would measure the effectiveness
- Demonstrate and discuss ethical responses in a community practice setting
- Describe what makes for effective interdisciplinary team processes

**Meta**: _Points_ 50 pts (10% of final grade); _Deadline_ Monday 05/05/25 by 8:00 AM _Completion_ via Microsoft Form - <https://forms.office.com/r/1TUGeQy3Sk>; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2425_SP-SOWK_487W-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=6f635790-f03d-4a8c-817a-eadaa5b9c2ab) and [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=4d1e149f-f06a-4ca0-be25-fa31e35fd25d).

**Purpose**: This task provides a formalized occasion to observe and provide feedback on group members' facilitation skills.

**Task**: Students will go to the Microsoft Form and provide feedback for each group member (through separate submissions). The instructor will email these submissions to their recipient. The actual content of the input does not affect student grades but demonstrates participation in the facilitation and gives feedback to their group members. 

**Success**: Students will submit meaningful feedback for each group member. Grades are pass/fail based only on whether the student submits feedback to their group members.

## Unit Resources

During class, we do an activity having students [prioritize their values](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=1bbb44ed-afb7-42b6-bcf0-2955162965fb). You can find the version version with the values as a handout. We will also be using some [ethical dilemma scenarios](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=ebb49424-b267-4782-b409-c7a47937584e) for a group discussion.
