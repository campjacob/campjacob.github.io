Looking forward to seeing everybody Saturday!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week seven is the penultimate week of class and is a synchronous week with attendance on 07/12/25. The Heritage Saturday for this session is a special one, focused on MSW program evaluation and career support. **Find the [planned schedule and potluck sign up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nSlJ58VDGrsCHLW0TcHJc8PZ7BndD5ZAKNMn0XAeYeU/edit?usp=sharing) for more information**. We will start the day at 9 am and will leave earlier than the typically scheduled end of day at 3 pm. I'm planning on bringing coffee and some pan dulce for the morning, if you'd like to arrive a bit early. If you have items that need to be warmed for the potluck, please consider this when planning your arrival so we can start promptly, as we have a busy day planned for you all. We have several agencies currently hiring MSWs who will be in attendance, presenting about their organizations. We also have a presentation from WorkSource about resumes and applying for local jobs. Consider dressing professionally to network and bring a copy of your resume that can be reviewed or shared. The Google Doc is a working document, so expect the agenda to continue updating as the week progresses.

Regarding class content this week. Students will complete reading Edin and Shafer (2016) and have the opportunity in the forums to reflect on the book and policy recommendations. The two chapters from Linquiti (2022) comprise the last five lenses in his set, utilizing a panoptic approach to policy analysis. There are forums where questions from the chapters are posted, and a place to consider our institutions. This week, students will also submit the second half of the course's key assignment, the Policy Analysis Advocacy Project.

The learning objectives this week include:

- Evaluate the final policy recommendations in _$2.00 a Day_ and critique their effectiveness and inclusivity for individuals living in deep poverty.   
- Analyze policy issues using the political, institutional, legal, sustainability, and science/technology lenses from Linquiti's framework.
- Reflect on the appropriate role of government institutions
- Demonstrate advocacy skills by translating a written policy analysis into a professional video presentation tailored for stakeholders.
- Apply principles of implementation planning, stakeholder mapping, and advocacy messaging to propose realistic and justice-centered policy change.

**Purpose**: The policy advocacy presentation builds on your written policy analysis by developing a compelling and well-structured advocacy presentation. Students will practice translating complex policy ideas into a format suitable for stakeholder engagement.

**Task**: Create an approximately 10-minute video presentation that builds upon your written policy analysis paper. Your presentation should include a visual element that helps summarize the content you are sharing (e.g., consider using presentation slides). This presentation should be structured as follows:

- **Introduction**: Present a clear and concise problem statement, identifying the social issue and briefly summarizing its root causes. Set the stage for why this issue matters and who it impacts.
- **Policy Analysis**: Provide an overview of the effectiveness of past and current policy efforts related to the issue. Analyze their impact across different system levels (micro, mezzo, macro). Include an analysis of stakeholders, identifying key decision-makers, supporters, advocacy organizations, or community members, and potential opponents.
- **Advocacy Strategy**: Describe your advocacy goal and objective. Identify your target audience and map out the relevant actors. Share your key advocacy messages, connecting them to the audience's values or concerns. Highlight approaches that can be used to advance your message. Include a persuasive call to action that reinforces urgency and purpose.
- **Implementation Plan**: Outline clear action steps along with associated roles, responsibilities, timeline, and resources. Address how you will monitor and evaluate progress. Explain the feasibility of your plan, accounting for real-world barriers, political dynamics, and enabling conditions.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize the key points from your presentation. Reflect on the potential social, racial, economic, and environmental justice implications of the policy issue and proposed solution. Reiterate the significance of the issue and inspire your audience toward action.

**Success**: A successful presentation will clearly explain the social issue and policy context, provide a well-supported advocacy strategy, and include a realistic implementation plan. It will demonstrate an understanding of key stakeholders, power dynamics, and barriers to change. The video will be organized, persuasive, and reflect core social work values, with thoughtful attention to justice and equity.

**Policy Advocacy Presentation and Competency 5 Practice Behaviors Rubric**

The _Policy Advocacy Presentation and Competency 5 Practice Behaviors Rubric_ evaluates students' ability to communicate their policy analysis through a strategic and persuasive advocacy presentation. It measures students' skills in articulating a clear problem statement, analyzing stakeholder roles, developing advocacy goals and messages, and proposing a realistic implementation plan. The rubric also assesses students' attention to power dynamics, barriers to change, and implications for social, racial, and economic justice. Effective presentations will be organized, professional, and grounded in advocacy strategies aligned with social work values and competencies.
