I'm just getting back from California and my week long trip for my intensive. I wanted to share the slides for this week with you before I went to sleep tonight, so they are below.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. This week the reading is:

- Garvin et al (2017) __Chapters 4-6  __

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Empowerment theory
- Ethics and social justice


The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
