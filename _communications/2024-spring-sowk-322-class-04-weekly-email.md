Welcome to Week Four. Hope you all have a great week. Let me know if there is anything I can help with or that you need.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week four, we move away from looking at the history and law around disability and start to understand identity development. This week you will read Rothman's (2018) chapter seven which provides a good overview of disability and identity. The objectives for weeks four include the following:

- Learn a theoretical model of identity development as it relates to disability.
- Apply the theoretical model to the activist you follow on Twitter.
- Begin to explore some birth defects.


## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Read Rothman's (2018) chapter seven Disability and Identity Development
- Watch my Lecture Video - [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 - Week 04](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5a77e40a-db86-4e77-a2fa-b10b015abf0b)
- Read Botto et al. (2017) and their [Birth Defects Descriptions for NBDPN Core](https://www.nbdpn.org/docs/Appendix_3_1_BirthDefectsDescriptions_2017MAR24.pdf) 
- Consider watching the videos included in the unit resources, including [Heather Evan's 2018 TEDx talk Uncovering: an Empowering Pathway to Disability Identity](https://youtu.be/WQsA_ItnGeg) and [Gaelynn Lea TEDx Talk 2017 TEDx talk Sexuality and Disability: Forging Identity in a World that Leaves You Out](https://youtu.be/akGYugciSVw)

**Aâ€“01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

Students are to make at least three replies across any four open forums this week. Remember, the expectation is to read all of the various replies made by your classmates. Your responses can include another student's reply if you contribute something substantial to the discussion. Be sure to post on two separate days to show engagement. The following are the four forums this week:

- The forum, [Chapter Discussion Regarding Disability and Identity](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-04_25_-_211.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=26b9a030-890b-43b5-9024-a92821b9add8), provides five different potential discussion questions that are also framed in chapter seven of the textbook.
- The [Initial Exposure to Birth Defects and Conditions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-04_25_-_211.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=cc80c72d-bac7-4f4d-a0d4-e15d95caef11) forum helps introduce students to the nine categories of congenital disabilities.
- To help keep on focus and attention watching the social media activist activist you are following for [assignment four](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=69a94ae4-4f6f-4b2d-8015-ece81a63c2a0), the forum [Your Social Media Activist and Identity Development](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-04_25_-_211.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=0ea11b9c-2efa-44db-81ed-56da182cee55) gives an avenue to share how they talk about their identity.
- Finally, the forum [Other Voices in Disability Identity to Showcase](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-04_25_-_211.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=952aa11b-4f9a-406c-aff1-8badfc910d4d) gives some options of videos to watch to understand disability identity or to allow you to find your own to share for examples of how persons with disabilities present and talk about their identity.


## Unit Resources

This week, we also will be starting to examine birth defects. The [National Birth Defects Prevention Network](https://www.nbdpn.org/) website provides useful information about birth defects.

Rothman's (2017) chapter seven provides an excellent overview of understanding disability identity. I would also encourage you to look at a couple of other sources. To provide you with a couple of examples, I am providing you with [Evans's (2018) talk](https://youtu.be/WQsA_ItnGeg), where she describes her concept of uncovering (TEDx Talks, 2018).

In her [2017 TEDx Talk](https://youtu.be/akGYugciSVw), Lea provides a powerful example of feeling left out of mainstream culture due to her physical disability and how she was able to forge her own identity.

All of the slides used for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are at [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 Week 04 - Developmental Theory in the Context of Disability](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/A63szw).

You can find the lecture video recording for this class in the [lecture videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Lecture_Videos.jnz?portlet=Learning_Tools&screen=InlineToolDisplayView&screenType=change&PlacementID=d53a7c40-76f9-4193-9314-fa7aa427cc89) link in the sidebar. This week's video is at [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 - Week 04](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5a77e40a-db86-4e77-a2fa-b10b015abf0b). I briefly relate Mackelprang and Salsgiver (2016) theory of human development and disability to a couple of client examples I have had over the years.
