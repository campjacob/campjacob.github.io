I hope you all are doing well this week. Keep me updated if there is anything I can help with.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week three for SOWK 590 is synchronous, with class on Saturday (02/08/25). Students will reflect on their practicum experience in their journal, have a student-led discussion regarding supervision, engage in mindfulness through gratitude, and participate in a group reflecting on their practice. The following is the agenda:


- SLED: Practicum Supervision/Supervision Agendas
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider intentionality and supervision and how they relate to their practice.

## Unit Assignments

**Attendance and In-Class Participation**

Attend class on Saturday.

**Weekly Reflective Journals**

Complete the [W-03 A-02 Reflective Journal](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_591/2425_SP-SOWK_591-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=1754e782-584d-4e7d-b0e4-58a4666e8ed6) by Sunday Night.

**Student-Led Discussion**

If you signed up to facilitate the SLED "Practicum Supervision/Supervision Agendas" session, please be prepared to review it in class. I would be particularly interested in how people utilize supervision in their practicum, what they get out of it, what agendas they might use, and why intentionality in our supervision could be helpful.

Please submit your signed form for [January Practicum Hours](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_596/2425_SP-SOWK_596-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=ebc16f88-f2a2-4c22-afb7-bc0781e27bc9), due before 2/15.

## Unit Resources

Our mindfulness activity for this week will be a free writing activity focused on gratitude. Actively appreciating the experiences we engage with in our daily lives appears to be a potent way to improve the quality of our social relationships, producing sustained improvements in psychological well-being and overall happiness (O'Connell et al., 2018, p. 2441). I've included [their paper this week](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=3daa3b4e-1dc4-45df-9e2e-66914e749457) if you would like to read through it. There is a powerful YouTube video that I'd also want you to watch by Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell (2019), titled [An Antidote to Dissatisfaction](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0).
