## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

We are ended the semester and I am looking forward to seeing everybody at commencement.

## Unit Assignments

Read Jarolmen and Bautista-Thomas (2023) _Chapter 13: Practice Evaluation_

I'm not having group forums this week. I am asking you to make **at least one reply** (See [Key Insights and Lessons from This Course](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/ðŸ’»_W-16_55-511.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=ed856d4f-9795-4e47-bf34-beee7349b2ab)) in a general forum sharing about some of what you have learned this semester or what stands out to you regarding school social work. I also expect all of you to complete the course evaluations for this (and all of your courses). You also have to submit your last paper, the full assignment description is as follows:

**A-01: School Intervention Assessment and Plan**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 150 pts (30% of final grade); _Deadline_ Monday 05/12/25 at 8:00 AM; _Completion_ via upload to MyHeritage Assignments; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=17668cfb-021e-49f5-a53d-9ce8d1a321e1) and [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=e63eea8a-5c9b-45e5-acd6-7461e49fa3fc);

**Purpose**: The _School Intervention Assessment and Plan_ builds on students' work, identifying school-based challenges and applying systems-based assessment and planning strategies. This assignment allows students to synthesize content across the course and demonstrate their ability to design interventions responsive to student needs, school culture, and systemic barriers. Students will engage in self-reflection, ethical decision-making, and demonstrate cultural humility while developing plans grounded in scientifically based practices.

**Task**: Students will write a paper detailing an intervention plan for a student. They may select a real student (with identifying details removed) or develop a fictional case. The paper should demonstrate the student's ability to assess needs and propose an intervention that addresses academic, behavioral, emotional, or social barriers. The paper must include:

- **Student Profile and Needs**: Provide a clear description of the student and their presenting challenges. Include contextual information about the student's background, strengths, and school setting. Analyze how aspects of the school culture or policies may contribute to or sustain the student's difficulties. Make connections to the student and macro-related concerns. Consider using the research done in your the _Social Policy Macro Issue_ paper and the _School-Related Problem Fact Sheet_ to guide your discussion.
- **Assessment Framing**: Use a person-in-environment and systems perspective to assess the problem. Describe how you identified the problem, referencing the assessment process and findings. The problem should be clearly defined and linked to patterns or conditions within the school or community. Discuss the case framing it based on systemic inequities and how they might influence the problem and the student's access to support.
- **Intervention Plan**: Develop a multilayered intervention plan that addresses needs at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels. Micro-level strategies may involve direct support to the student (e.g., individual counseling or skill-building); mezzo-level strategies might include peer support, family engagement, or classroom-wide accommodations; and macro-level strategies could involve policy recommendations, school-wide programming, or shifts in school culture. Include scientifically based practices with supporting citations.
- **Resource Identification and Brokering:** Identify the community, school-based, or technological resources the student will access as part of the plan. Highlight how you will broker services and collaborate with other professionals (e.g., teachers, administrators, counselors). Explain how cultural competence informs your understanding of available resources and how access can be equitable and relevant for the student's identity and context.
- **Cultural Competency and Anti-Racism:** Reflect on how your identity, biases, and privileges may impact your assessment and planning process. Incorporate an element into your plan that explicitly aims to dismantle structurally racist policies or practices. This may include removing barriers to services, advocating for inclusive programs, or targeting historically underserved student populations.

**Success**:  A successful submission will demonstrate a comprehensive assessment of a student's needs within the context of school culture and systemic influences. The intervention plan will be clearly structured, actionable, and span micro, mezzo, and macro levels, incorporating scientifically based practices. Students will thoughtfully integrate relevant resources and outline collaborative strategies with school and community partners. Strong assignments will include self-reflection on personal bias and privilege, and propose interventions that actively dismantle structurally racist policies or practices. The final product will be professionally written, well-organized, and adhere to APA formatting and assignment guidelines.


**School Intervention Assessment and Plan Rubric**

The _School Intervention Assessment and Plan Rubric_ assesses students' ability to analyze student needs within a school context, frame a problem using relevant data and systems-level thinking, and develop a feasible, multilayered intervention plan. The rubric also measures students' capacity to integrate school and community resources, demonstrate collaborative practice, and reflect critically on issues of bias, privilege, and ADEI. Students are expected to apply ethical reasoning, use scientifically based practices, and present their work in a clear, organized, and scholarly manner that adheres to APA formatting standards and assignment requirements.

**Competency 3: Engage Anti-Racism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ADEI) in Practice**  
a. Summarize internalized racial bias by self-reflecting on personal history, power, position, and opportunities for change.  
b. Utilize social work research, community-based education, social justice practices, policy analysis and advocacy, and/or non-profit administration and leadership to dismantle structurally racist practices and policies.  


|Description | Initial | Emerging | Developed | Highly Developed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Self-Reflection on Internalized Racial Bias** | Does not include self-reflection on bias. | Self-reflection on bias is limited or vague. | Reflects on biases, but does not fully explore identity, privilege, and positionality and/or does not consider opportunities for personal growth. | Provides a clear, insightful reflection on personal identity, privilege, and positionality. Thoughtfully examines internalized bias and identifies intentional strategies for growth and change. |
| **Dismantling Structurally Racist Practices and Policies** | Does not address structural racism or propose related interventions. | Recognizes structural racism but proposed actions are vague or disconnected from ADEI principles. | Identifies structurally racist practices and proposes general strategies, but lacks supporting sources and/or does not clearly connect interventions to systems-level thinking | Applies scientifically based approaches to identify and address structural racism. Proposes specific, actionable steps grounded in ADEI principles and systems-level understanding. |

**General Assignment Expectations**

|Description | Initial | Emerging | Developed | Highly Developed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Assessment and Problem Framing** | Student needs are vague or missing. Problem is unclear, lacks context. No meaningful connection to school culture or systemic issues. | Describes the student's needs but lacks depth or clarity. Problem is identified but not well-supported contextual discussion and it is not connected to school culture or systemic influences. | Student needs are described. The problem is framed by the school context. Connections to school culture and systemic factors are made but may need more depth. | Provides a well-articulated and comprehensive assessment of the student's needs. The problem is clearly defined and situated within school culture and broader systemic issues. |
| **Intervention Plan and Implementation** | Intervention plan is missing, unrealistic, or lacks coherence.  | A basic intervention plan is presented but lacks detail and the plan only includes one or two levels of intervention. | Intervention plan is logical and includes micro, mezzo, and macro elements. Strategies are generally discussed but lack discussion of evidence. | Presents a clear, feasible, and multilayered intervention plan with specific actions at all three levels. Integrates scientifically supported practices with strong justification for selected strategies |
| **Resource Integration and Collaboration** | Few or no resources are identified. Collaboration is not discussed. | Mentions some relevant resources and collaboration, but the discussion is limited or underdeveloped. | Includes appropriate resources and outlines basic strategies for collaboration. | Demonstrates thoughtful integration of relevant school, community, and technological resources. Collaboration is clearly planned. |
| **Organization, Clarity, and APA Formatting** | The paper lacks clear organization; tone is informal or inappropriate for academic paper; | Some organization is evident but ideas may be disjointed; tone is uneven or somewhat unprofessional; Citations and references are mostly missing or significantly flawed. | The paper is generally well-organized with a mostly professional tone; minor APA formatting errors are present but do not detract significantly from clarity. | The paper is clearly and logically organized with a consistently professional, action-oriented tone; APA citations and references are accurate and properly formatted throughout. |
| **Following assignment requirements** | Does not follow the assignment description. | Somewhat follows the assignment description, but significant errors exist. | Follows the assignment description and requirements but has minor errors. | Closely follows the assignment description and requirements. |
