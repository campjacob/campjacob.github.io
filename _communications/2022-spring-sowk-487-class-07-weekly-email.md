I'm very excited that we get to meet in person this week. Remember, we meet at 5:30 PM and we will be in the SWL building in room 108. Please let me know if you won't be able to attend in person. I think this will be a great class for us to be doing in person and is mostly activity focused.


## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week seven, we continue to focus on working with families. Students are expected to read Prest and Protinsky (1993). We will continue to talk about the dimensions of family assessments. The class session should be reasonably practical with several activities. The plan is as follows:


- Specific tools for working with families
- Dysfunctional family roles
- Some standard techniques for working with families

## Unit Resources

You **need to read** Prest and Protinsky (1993).

<div style="margin: 0 0 0 2em; text-indent: -2em;" markdown="1">

Prest, L. A., & Protinsky, H. (1993). Family systems theory: A unifying framework for co-dependence. _The American Journal of Family Therapy, 21_(4), 352-360. <https://doi.org/10.1080/01926189308251005>

During the class session we will be going through a number of handouts. You don't have to print them. There are a couple that I will have printed copies of to share in class. The following are the handouts for this class session

- [Holistic Wellness Wheel](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=d338ab66-2d9d-4037-b798-77dd91ee4413)
- [Invalidating vs Invaliding Statements](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=e54a9e12-ba18-47e9-b9a3-268c6d9391fc)
- [Fifteen Fair Fighting Rules](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=8baf4016-9071-4d48-bd08-b896a84ff2b0)
- [Time-Outs](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=594dba4f-faa8-42cc-941f-c6286f8fcf9f)

Because next week, we will be doing [Assignment 02: Family Treatment Modality Research Presentation](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=40ba42ff-3bf5-4a2e-ab30-60099e3b58f5) during class, I have also created a handout for just that assignment. It is the same information that is included in the syllabus. You could search for the journal article I have for this week's reading, but I have attached it here as well [Family Systems Theory: A Unifying Framework for Co-dependence](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=273c93fb-5a9d-4823-b6bd-7620438a9b37).

During class, we will talk a little about working with families and teaching skills related to positive and negative reinforcement and positive and negative punishment. I created a video, [Changing Problematic Behaviors, Principles of Operant Conditioning](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/01/changing-problematic-behaviors-principles-operant-conditioning/) that students can watch to get some practical ideas of what this is.

[![Changing Problematic Behaviors](https://jacobrcampbell.com/assets/media/punishment-reinforcement-operant-conditioning-500x300.png "Title")](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/01/changing-problematic-behaviors-principles-operant-conditioning/)

I really value feedback about how the classes I teach are going. There are two opportunities each semester, in the middle of the semester (e.g., now!) and the end, to provide feedback about the course. I do read this and have an honest desire to be the best teacher I can be. I'd be grateful if you would consider completing the [Spring 2022 Midterm Feedback for SOWK 487 Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=00BEBFBD-7702-48DE-8EF2-5A8F474780DC&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=50LB2IZ343).

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
