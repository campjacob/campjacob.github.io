I hope that you all had a great weekend and have been enjoying the start of the program. I don't have everything created and developed for week two for this class yet, but I have a good start and the forums are all ready for you and I wanted to make sure you were all aware it was ready for you. I will update the course page a bit later this week and see you all on Saturday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

I will update this introduction to include learning objectives and an agenda as we approach the class. I wanted to share the forum content with you all.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 3 _Overview of the Helping Process_
- Read Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 4 _Operationalizing Social Work Values and Ethics_

**A-02 W-01 Asynchronous Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are four forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- In the [First Impressions and Getting Started with Clients](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/üè´_W-02_91-97.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=AddPost&screenType=change&tId=487f98b8-2fb6-4a73-bc61-b54086d5d311) forum, students reflect on how first encounters shape helping relationships and explore ways to build strong therapeutic alliances from the start.
