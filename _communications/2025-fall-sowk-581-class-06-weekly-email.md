The forums are ready for you for this week. See you all on Saturday!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week six is a synchronous class week, with an in-person session on Saturday (10/04). Having spent time in class examining the theoretical basis of an integrated approach to clinical practice, the assessment process, biopsychosocial assessments, the DSM-5-TR, and multicultural practice, we will now focus on specific practice implementations within the integrated approach. I do have an activity where we will be reviewing the DSM, and I would like you to bring your copy with you to class. This week's readings include two chapters from Cooper and Granucci's Lesser (2022) work, which presents two relational psychodynamic models: object relations theory and self-psychology.

The learning objectives this week include

- Develop an appreciation of the evolution of relational psychodynamic models
- Understand the concepts of object relations and self-object
- Discuss the concept of trauma bonding
- Apply self-psychology to a brief group intervention
- Develop the context of attachment theory
- Learn a simple model for sharing about the functions of the brain

Agenda

I'll share the class agenda as we get closer.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 5 _Object Relations Theory: A Relational Psychodynamic Model_
- Read Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 6 _Self-Psychology: A Relational Psychodynamic Model_

- Watch Siegel's (2017) YouTube video, _Dr. Dan Siegel's Hand Model of the Brain_

**W-06 A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are four forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- The [chapters five and six reflections questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-06_929-105.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=02daf8cc-6bab-4d37-8b7f-2332be955c5e) forum explores the readings and asks you to make connections to the vignettes and the content presented in these chapters.
- Self-psychology can be useful in developing group interventions, and the textbook provided an example of going through the beginning, middle, and end phases of a group using it. In the forum [planning a group intervention using self-psychology](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-06_929-105.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=a28a0c50-9332-464c-a67f-601bbe5547cd), you can share some ideas for how you could do some pre-planning for such a group.
- [Further engagement with object relation theory](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-06_929-105.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=5e51ff24-64db-4f8f-9de2-160e73181102) forum asks you to increase your connection to and understanding of object relation theory by connecting it with the cyclical maladaptive pattern, trauma bonding, or splitting behaviors.
- Finally, the forum [reflection on additional materials for week six](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-06_929-105.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=fac34c78-fc87-459f-838a-bd440a6ecc4e) is a space to share findings and insight gained from the extra materials I shared.

**Reading Quizzes**

Complete [W-06 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapters 05 & 06](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=cfb02ee3-1659-4d03-ac36-d33ed9a45a51) is due before Saturday 10/4, 8:00 AM.

## Unit Resources

Attachment theory is briefly discussed in both chapters you read this week. It is a complex and multifaceted subject that can offer valuable insights into our clinical practice. The Knowledge Center has an entire podcast looking at different viewpoints related to attachment. Kelly's (2023) episode, featuring an interview with Eli Harwood, is excellent and provides valuable background and insights into understanding attachment in action. I especially appreciated her relating attachment styles to animals. You can find the episode in the [Apple Podcast App](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/nerd-ing-out-on-secure-attachments-eli-harwood/id1305291387?i=1000638336250), [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+AASzVYcMkr8)[^1], [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4j7DtkYrDYxmmboAxBxoG8?si=B8GDvFB9RsKKc-EICYx5lA), or the [podcast's website](https://www.attachmenttheoryinaction.com/episodes/episode/c7fbc1dc/nerd-ing-out-on-secure-attachments-eli-harwood
). The episode is about an hour long. I often listen to podcasts when doing other things (washing dishes, going for a walk, driving, etc.); they are a great way to continue learning.

Both textbook chapters cite Dan Siegel in their discussion of these theories. While they cite a book he wrote, _The Developing Mind_, I really like Siegal and have [consumed a lot of his material](https://drdansiegel.com). Chapter six asks you to consider self-psychology from a neuroscientific perspective. While Siegel's hand model of the brain does not explicitly talk about this, it is a tool I have often used in my conversations with clients to help them understand what is happening when they are "flipping their lid." I'd like you to watch his video [Dr. Dan Siegel's Hand Model of the Brain](https://youtu.be/f-m2YcdMdFw?si=qUoqBRh9DAvO-ozI). It is only about eight minutes.

Knowing that some of you are waiting until the class session to pick up your textbook, I have chapters five and six added as a resource below. 

I am still working on the slides and agenda for our class session on Saturday, but I will share it before class.

The [Lecture Videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Lecture_Videos.jnz) tab in the MyHeritage course is where you will be able to find class recordings. The video this week is at `[Fall 2025 SOWK 581 Week 06]()`.
