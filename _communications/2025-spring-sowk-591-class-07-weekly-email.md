## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week seven for SOWK 591 is synchronous, with class on Saturday (03/08/25). Students will reflect on their practicum experience in their journals. During class, we will have a student-led discussion regarding an the planned change process, engage in mindfulness through breathing, and participate in a group reflecting on their practice. The following is the agenda:

- Complete midterm feedback
- SLED: Planned Change Process
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will provide feedback to help guide this course.
- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider the planned change process and how that can be implemented.

## Unit Resources

For our mindfulness activity this week, I am sharing an example of a [GoNoodle video](https://www.gonoodle.com),  [Whale Breath](https://www.gonoodle.com/videos/ywe97w/whale-breath). If you work in elementary school, there are a lot of different kinds of activities that can be helpful for students. There are many breathing exercises, energizing exercises (e.g., brainercise, guided dance), and purposeful movement (stretching and exercises). When I was at the school district and Children's Day center, staff sometimes used these with our behavior students during class.

Our student-led discussion this week is centered on the planned change process. We do this as social workers to effect change through our clients. Hepworth et al. (2022) describe three phases that workers go through, including:

- Phase I: Exploration, Engagement, Assessment, and Planning
- Phase II: Implementation and Goal Attainment
- Phase III: Evaluation and Termination

Other scholars will frame these in different formats, such as the generalist intervention model, but social workers use the planned change process to affect change in their clients.
