I will see you all in just a little bit.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Students will be submitting their logic models this week and should be considering their agency as a whole. The reading from Royse (2023) looks at formative and process evaluations, and we will start class by looking at some of the considerations we should have for process evaluations. During week seven, we will be considering your research question so that you can narrow down exactly what part of the program you are evaluating is being examined. Student will complete their logic models this week. During class, we will discuss how to use our logic models to develop a program description. There will also be a discussion about presentations, and students will be able to complete midterm feedback.

- Developing a research question
- Presentation planning
- Developing a program description
- Midterm feedback

**A-04c: Agency Logic Model**

**Meta**: _Points_ 100 pts (10% of student's final grade); _Deadline_ Sunday <strike>03/02/25</strike> 03/09/25 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ via a forum post on MyHeritage; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=4a0f5f3c-057d-46bf-a888-a89511b9bb1e), [Submission Forum](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-06_224-32.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=d37955b3-db3b-49a9-bd75-3ddc23a3c148), and [Syllabus Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=a2a11be2-095a-478a-a40c-bcdb9b3c5a89).

**Purpose**: Developing a logic model is an essential part of program evaluation. Groups will include the logic model in the executive summary and presentation. They will submit it as a forum post, and during class, they will engage in peer review. This process will help groups formulate a superior final product.

**Task**: Group members will interview staff working at their evaluation agency. The logic model looks at how a program is implemented through understanding the program's resources, staff activities, program processes, and outcomes (often framed as immediate, intermediate, and long-range). Royse (2022) provides some context to this in chapter six.

**Success**: The logic model will be submitted by group members onto the forum. See Appendix B for the rubric. Grades are assigned based on the content of the logic model. Feedback for this assignment will be completed by mid-term grades submission, due by the faculty on Wednesday 03/26/25 at 5:00 PM.

**Appendices B. Agency Logic Model Rubric**

The _Agency Logic Model Rubric_ evaluates student-using a student-developed rubric developed during 2024. It focuses on visual clarity, resources, staff activities, program processes, and outcomes. Visual/clarity assesses the identification of components. Resources evaluate the identification of agency resources. Staff activities review descriptions of agency services. Program processes assess descriptions of intended agency services. Short-term outcomes evaluate the definition of expected changes, including the target audience, time frame, and desired level of change. Immediate-term outcomes review data collection and connection to program goals. Long-term outcomes assess the identification of data, outcomes, and implementations.

| Description | Initial | Emerging | Developed | Highly Developed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Visual/Clarity | Unable to identify the components | Able to identify 3 of the components | Able to identify 4 of the components | Able to identify all of the components. The chart is easy to read and visually appealing |
| Resources | No identification of resources | Limited or unclear identification of resources | The majority of resources were identified | Complete understanding of resources identified |
| Staff Activities | Minimal to no description of staff services provided by the agency | Seldom description of the staff services provided by the agency | Partial description of most of the staff services provided by the agency | A clear description of all staff services provided by the agency |
| Program Processes | Minimal to no description of the intended service(s) of the agency | Seldom a description of half of the intended service(s) of the agency | Partial description of most of the intended service(s) of the agency | Clear description of the intended service(s) of the agency |
| Short-Term Outcomes | Limited or no data collected. Brief and unclear statements | Some data was collected, but it is very brief with little detail | Defines the expected change in the program | Specifies the target audience, time frame, and desired level of change |
| Immediate Term Outcomes | Did not develop data collection or incomplete | It shows some connection to activities but needs clarification | Explains how the changes were implemented to the program's goals | Identifies relevant data collection methods to track the progress of program evaluation |
| Long-Term Outcomes | Vague or no data and outcomes identified | The outcome has been identified, but it is brief and unclear. The data is somewhat relevant to the outcome | Describes new implementations and long-term outcome goals; minor additions are needed to develop the logic model's long-term outcomes | Implementations and Long-term outcomes are identified and specified in depth under each category based on program-needed change(s) at the agency |

## Unit Resources

You can find your [midterm course evaluation form](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=C5E13D38-B327-4A8D-91C1-1B587789EB6C&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=D0KEKIU302).

We will do an activity using a tool from the Canadian community solutions [Evaluation Resources](https://www.communitysolutions.ca/logic-model-puzzles) website.

We will be using O'Leary (2018) book on research questions. I really liked the little quick fix series for breaking down some parts of research. You can find [the series online](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/little-quick-fix).

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Spring 2025 SOWK 460w Week 07 - Building the Foundation of a Program Evaluation](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/UBhMvh).
