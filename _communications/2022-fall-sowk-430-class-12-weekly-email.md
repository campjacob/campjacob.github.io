**A-04: Ethical Decision-Making Case Study Group Chat**

**Meta**: _Points_ 75 points (12% of total points); _Deadline_ Sunday 11/13/22 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ via My Heritage Assignments as an uploaded document. [A-04: Ethical Decision-Making Case Study Group Chat](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=fc7c5554-9142-415a-a44c-98b3562cfa8e) There is [a handout with group assignments](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=6b27ab03-ad8b-42d0-b0a5-2907670bcc74) that can be viewed. You can find a [PDF description of just this assignment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=3a6a5c0e-b3a1-43b3-b884-7dd3d3550723). You can also find a copy of the [Case Study for A–04 Ethical Decision-Making Group Chat](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=862d41cf-4fe8-40ae-a95f-360ac575cd9c).

**Purpose**: The _Group Chat and Ethical Case Discussion_ assignment is used for students to provide evidence of the skill of discussing a case example using an ethical framework. The project is completed online via a chat feature to capture your real-time contributions to the discussion.

**Task**: Students will be assigned a group with three or four members. Students should arrange a time to meet online with their designated group to complete this assignment. In advance, select software that will allow you to have an instant message conversation. The software needs to have a way to print the conversation you had together so you can save the conversation as a PDF. Consider web apps you can access on your computer, such as Google Chat, WhatsApp, etc. You should do a test run before your planned meeting to work out any technical issues. 

During the chat, you will review a case study (this can be accessed in the assignment description) and discuss the ethical issues using the NASW Essential Steps for Ethical Problem-Solving Framework. You will focus on Steps 1-4 and will be expected to reference specific standards from the NASW Code of Ethics.

Before you begin the chat, make sure that the following items are in place:

- Each person has reviewed the case study and has made personal notes to refer to throughout the discussion. Your contributions will be much more substantive the more you have prepared.
- Each person has access to a copy of the NASW Code of Ethics.
- Each person has access to a copy of the Essential Steps.
- Plan for at least 1 hour, and please make sure your chat length is at least 30 minutes.

This assignment is related to this course's assignment five. While it does not use the same rubric, the same type of content is expected. Students are encouraged to review A-05: Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Model Paper for further insight into the material to include in your discussion.

**Success**: One group member will submit a copy of the chat they had with their group. Grades for this assignment will be based on both group and individual participation. Grades will be assessed using the _Ethical Decision-Making Case Study Group Chat Rubric_. The group portion looks at their ability to follow the assignment guidelines, the thoroughness of the discussion, and the critical analysis that happens in the chat. Individuals will also be scored related to their level of contribution to the dialog.

## Unit Resources

The [NASW Code of Ethics](https://www.socialworkers.org/About/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics/Code-of-Ethics-English) (2021) is available online and in your textbook and is helpful in your discussion about the case examples.
