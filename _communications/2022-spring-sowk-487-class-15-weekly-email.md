## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

The readings this week are from Schulz (2017), who focuses on assessing Community-Based Participatory Research Partnerships (CPBRP), Bronstein and Abramson (2017), who help us look into interdisciplinary teamwork and the skills and processes necessary to be successful in its implementation. Finally, Ephross et al. (2017) provide an overview of best practices with task groups. During class, we will do an activity around organizing our priorities and ethics as well as lecture on the learning content for the week. The learning objectives for this week include:

- Be able to explain what a Community-Based Participatory Research Partnerships is and some of the criteria for how we would measure the effectiveness
- Demonstrate and discuss ethical responses in a community practice setting
- Describe what makes for effective interdisciplinary team processes
