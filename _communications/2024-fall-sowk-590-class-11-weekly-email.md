## Unit Resources

Harborview Abuse & Trauma Center has their [CBT + NOTEBOOK](https://depts.washington.edu/uwhatc/cbt-notebook/). This is a fabulous resource. I'd encourage you to spend some time reviewing it, it also connects a lot to the work we are doing this week in SOWK 581. We are going to do an activity tangentially related to the turtle technique that they offer for our mindfulness activity during class. I'm pairing this activity with coloring exercise that we will be doing. If you are interested in an interesting literature review related to coloring and mindfulness Mantzis and Giannou (2018) is somewhere you could start. You can find [Turtle Technique with Coloring Mandala](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9020fdec-00b2-4baf-8775-71fc838afbc9) as an attached handout. You can also find the presentation slides [Week 11 - Advanced Seminar I](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=19aa8f9c-e4a6-417b-a7bc-6645b879f34d).
