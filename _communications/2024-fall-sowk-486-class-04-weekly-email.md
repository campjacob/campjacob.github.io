Sorry to be a little late to upload the unit introductions and resources. Just a reminder that I have posted all of the reading quizzes and assignments so you know when things are coming up (as well it's listed in the syllabus). Looking forward to seeing you all on Wednesday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week four is a continuation of laying the groundwork for this course. It is focused on providing an overview of the helping process. The Hepworth et al. (2022) text formats the helping process into three phases. 

- Phase 1: Exploration, Engagement, Assessment, and Planning
- Phase II: Implementation and Goal Attainment
- Phase III: Evaluation and Termination

During the session, we will be examining an overview of considerations we should have in each of the phases. We will also be looking at how we set the environment with our clients and what the interviewing process looks like. Finally, we will spend some time discussing some potential ethical dilemmas. The agenda is:

- Overview of the three phases of the helping process
- Setting the environment
- Interviewing clients
- Practice with ethical dilemmas

## Unit Resources

In talking about rapport and connection with clients, we review Leach (2015) to understand some of the strategies and behaviors that improve client trust. You can read the paper if you are interested.
