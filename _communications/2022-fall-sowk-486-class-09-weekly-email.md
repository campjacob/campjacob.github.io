## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week nine is a continuation of the work we started in week seven and looking at assessments. The focus is diving more into social histories, with an opportunity to practice asking questions related to this in small groups. As well, students do their teach-back activity if there is time we will do some activities around genograms and eco-maps.
