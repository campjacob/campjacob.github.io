## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week four, we continue with our consideration and work on understanding and working with families. You have to do readings to go over outside of the textbook. First, Chovil (2009) a report that helps explain some of the best practices in working with and engaging families. It also provides context to what roles families can play in developing and promoting services. As you read Anderson-Butcher et al. (2004), we will also be the first to focus on the connection that families might have to other types of groups. Next, you can watch a short documentary about services for families, Administration for Children and Families (2015). During class, we will also be spending time talking about potential family roles and some specific tools for doing family work.

The following is the agenda for week four:

- Specific tools for working with families
- Dysfunctional family roles
- Some standard techniques for working with families

## Unit Resources

I don't have a citation for where I originally got the Wellness Wheel, but many places use this type of thing. You can see the version we [used in class](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=34c7ebc3-4ffe-44d3-9c93-ed962b6a40a6). I used the implementation teaching about this activity as my teaching demonstration as a part of my hiring process for Heritage. You can see the related presentation [Helping Understand Balance: Using the Holistic Wellness Wheel as a Tool for Practice and Assessment](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/v7YhDE/) if you would like to see more information about the tool. 

This week, you are watching Administration for Children and Families (2015) [Building Community, Building Hope](https://youtu.be/IuSG7MY8pfI). This is an excellent short documentary that is about 20 minutes.

As we talk about supporting families in changing behavior, one of the strategies is operant conditioning. I made a short YouTube video about positive and negative reinforcement and positive and negative punishment that you can watch. [Changing Problematic Behaviors, Principles of Operant Conditioning](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/01/changing-problematic-behaviors-principles-operant-conditioning/) that students can watch to get some practical ideas of what this is.

I made a video about [Strengths-Based Engagement with Families](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2020/03/strengths-based-engagement-with-families-youtube-video/) that talked about barriers to engagement by families and some strategies for supporting engagement from families.
