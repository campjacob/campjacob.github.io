I am looking forward to your ideas for your group project. See you on Saturday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week five is synchronous, with a class session on Saturday, 2/21. Students will read chapter seven of the textbook, which presents strategies for implementing organizational change. The forums this week are a space for students to pitch their community-impact projects before submitting their final proposals. The agenda for the in-person class session will be updated in the course page as we get closer to Saturday.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Kirst-Ashman and Hull (2018) _Chapter 7: Implementing Organizational Change: Agency Policy, Projects, and Programs_

**W-05 A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

This week, the forums are a space to submit a pitch for your community impact project (see [W-05 A-03 Community Impact Project Pitch](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_531/2526_SP-SOWK_531-0/🏫_W-05_216-222.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=695950df-8b2b-401f-a442-da920d36685b)). Your final proposal (see [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=49677e29-e42e-4ae8-ba05-f5d76ee70d00)) is due Monday, 03/02/26 at 8:00 AM. You should be starting to work on this. This forum will give you the opportunity to hear your peers' ideas, which might help you generate your own. It will also be a space to hear feedback and review of your plans from your peers' perspectives. I would like everyone to make **an initial post** sharing a basic pitch for your project, and then make at least **two replies** across your own or your peers' posts. I have also created a post where you can ask [Questions About A-03 A: Community Impact Project Proposal](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_531/2526_SP-SOWK_531-0/🏫_W-05_216-222.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=8d9249ef-01bb-473b-9bf0-23b0b59c4102).

## Unit Resources

I will add the slides and any needed handouts closer to the class on Saturday, as I'm still developing my plan.

It looks like there are a couple of people who haven't added their name to the Google Doc I created last week, [Community Assessment Group Project Planning Teams](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18YWQpdnhBu8d9BTziURcfOKHGtLaIEkKIA8NzagNwtM/edit?usp=sharing). It does appear groups one and two have their five members and have top picks for doing their assessment, respectively, in Ellensburg and Wapato. The two people who haven't signed up yet should add their names to the doc, and the whole group should talk internally to make sure everybody is on board with the number one pick for your community.

You can listen to a podcast episode for this week's reading [Chapter 7: Implementing Organizational Change: Agency Policy, Projects, and Programs](https://vsp.ink/podcasts/deep-dive-kirst-ashman-and-hull-2018/07-implementing-organizational-change-agency-policy-projects-and-programs/), or see the entire series [Podcast Series](https://vsp.ink/deep-dive-kirst-ashman-and-hull-2018/).
