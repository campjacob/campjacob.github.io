I hope that you all had a wonderful weekend. I'm looking forward to class this week. We will be laying some foundational information about group work in general and helping to set the stage for what group work is like.

In having Martin Luther King Jr.'s celebration, I thought that I would share one of my favorite speeches of his. It really looks at his ecological viewpoint on the world.

You can even a short essay I wrote last semester, [Holistic Worldview and A Comparasson with Social Work](https://jacobrcampbell.com/resources/essays/holistic-worldview-and-a-comparasson-with-social-work/), talking about about this speech and a holistic worldview.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. This week the reading is:

- Garvin et al (2017) __Chapter 1 to 3__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Overview of working with groups
- Group dynamics and roles
- Tools and strategies in groups


The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
