I'm looking forward to seeing you this week and seeing you all.
## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

For the first four weeks of class, we will focus on groups in family work. This week you will read Hepworth et al. (2022) _Chapter 10 Assessing Family Functioning in Diverse Family and Cultural Contexts_. The assessment is the foundation for any successful service. Some of the dimensions we must look at include: family structure, including homeostasis, boundaries, power and decision-making, roles, rules, life cycle, and sociopolitical environment

- Strengths perspective and families
- Engagement and assessment with families
