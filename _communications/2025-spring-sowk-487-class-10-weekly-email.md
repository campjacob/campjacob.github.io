I hope that you all have had a wonderful spring Spring Break and I will see you tonight.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week 10, we start looking at treatment groups. To look at this, we will use the example of three types of groups. The week's readings are around these topics. I also want to share some example curricula that you can see and review to get a picture of what this looks like. All of the readings for this week are good information, and I think they will help give you some perspective. Dialectical behavioral therapy is a frequently used group format, and Rizvi et al. (2013) provide a helpful overview of what it looks like. Next, Rose (2004) gives the example of cognitive-behavioral group work (CBGW). Even though most curricula don't explicitly describe themselves as being founded in CBGW, I could argue that they are. Finally, Roffman (2004) reviews psychoeducational groups.

The agenda for week 10 is as follows:

- Group Intervention Pitch
- Psychoeducational group skills
- Curriculum used with psychoeducational or CBGW
- Phases of the group process for CBGW
- Information about DBT
- Planning and implementation group

**Purpose**: The purpose of the pitch is to provide a deadline for planning the group intervention for the student and for the instructor to feel confident in the student's plan.

**Task**: Each group will make a short informal pitch for the group they plan to facilitate during the 10th-week class session. As a group, students will share with their classmates their plan to implement their group (i.e., when and where) and the content they will do for their groups. These presentations should be at most five minutes.

**Success**: Students will have a plan for facilitating their group. I grade students following 0 = no plan, 12.5 = has a plan and appears moderately prepared, and 25 points for has a plan and appears ready to facilitate the group.

## Unit Resources

This week, there are again a number of handouts that we will be spending some time reviewing. I will have printed and ready the ones you need in class. I'm uploading them, as it might be helpful to have saved them and looked over them a little bit. In the course of our discussion of Cognitive-Behavioral Group Work, I wanted to offer some examples of what the manuals can look like. You will be broken up into groups and given a chance to read "thumb through" the material and talk about it together.
