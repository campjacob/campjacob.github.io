Remember, we do not have in-person classes this week. Have a wonderful week!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 is focused on online group work and using technology to create groups. Cabiati (2021) provides the example of an online support group with social workers as the participants. Barak et al. (2008) provide some context for enhancing empowerment for online support groups. Students will also listen to a podcast episode exploring using virtual reality in social work. The forums for this week provide space for students to consider the content for the week and discuss their planned use of technology in their practice.
