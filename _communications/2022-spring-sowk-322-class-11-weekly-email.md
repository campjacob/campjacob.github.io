## Unit 11 Introduction and What You Will Learn

Assessment is a core activity we do as social workers. Chapter 12 of the Rothman (2018) shares many practical strategies used to assess persons with special needs. The objectives for week 11 are as follows:

The following are the four forums this week:

- The [Areas of Assessment for Persons with Disabilities](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-11_328_-_43.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=0f5ffcb2-57b6-45fd-840d-aec98040f0d3) forum allows students to share what types of questions they would formulate to assess persons with special needs.
- Students will apply the supplemental reading on the Social Security Administrations website and share back information about the process in the forum [SSI Evaluation Process](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-11_328_-_43.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=77abbaf3-1751-4a45-b5ea-b83b96c5a3ad)
- The [Quality of Life Assessment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-11_328_-_43.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=b368ab73-6fe0-4bd4-a4ee-74ebd5e92499) (QOL) forum has students look to use the process described in the textbook for assessing QOL.
- The forum, [Discussion Questions Posed in Chapter 12](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-11_328_-_43.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=771e1298-ab4c-4423-b01e-7489cb37e333), provides five different potential discussion questions that come from the textbook


## Unit Resources:

Junker (2021) describes very succinctly describes what the difference is between Social Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), determination of eligibility, benefit amounts, how to apply, and even appealing. In my experience with clients who have been applying for SSI, they often have had to appeal multiple times. [Applying for SSI](https://youtu.be/J8XRgU37m7A) or if you prefer watching in Spanish ([Solicitar la SSI](https://youtu.be/EjDN0Qb6uNQ)).

The Social Security Administration (n.d.) [Disability Evaluation Under Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/) includes information about what disabilities are included for adults and children, general information around applying for SSI, what type of documentation is required, provided for professionals to help assist clients in going through the process. Read through the martial in these sections to gain a deeper understanding of what the process looks like and assist in participating in the forum [SSI Evaluation Process](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2122_SP-SOWK_322-0/W-11_328_-_43.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=77abbaf3-1751-4a45-b5ea-b83b96c5a3ad).
