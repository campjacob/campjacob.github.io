I hope that you are all well. Looking forward to seeing you all tonight!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

During week eight, we will look at potential design methods for your program evaluation. This discussion must start with some work to identify your research questions. We are going to spend some time doing a peer review of your logic models. We will also discuss data sources and some critical components of evaluations. We can also consider the threats to validity to develop a more robust and more valid evaluation. Finally, we will review some examples of group design methods that could be used. The agenda is as follows:

- Developing your research question
- Peer Review Logic Models
- Key components for evaluation methods
- Threats to validity
- Types of group designs

## Unit Resources

If you didn't submit feedback last week, you can find  it at [Midcourse Feedback Spring 2024 Survey for SOWK 460](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=C4891C44-BE32-4F73-B833-B79DDAF1D794&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=Z0Z03R6324).

We are going to be peer-reviewing your logic models. There is a warm up activity that is included in a set of [Evaluation Resources](https://communitysolutions.ca/web/free-resources-menu-version/) and the interactive logic model puzzles found there. You can find the rubric we made last week in the Google Doc [Logic Model Rubric for SOWK 460w](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BdGh8FOVilFK2yOvWh-TV5AGwGUa-LA5565jdBDoZY/edit?usp=sharing). You can find the forum where these were submitted at [A-04c: Agency Logic Model Submission Forum](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2324_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-06_219_-_225.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=2ff42599-2e69-43e2-b08d-898d0cd2d4dc).

We are going to talk about potential survey questions. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2011) provides a [tip sheet](https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/docs/constructing_survey_questions_tip_sheet.pdf) for constructing survey questions that we will be reviewing. 

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. You can see this week's slides at [Spring 2024 SOWK 460w Week 08: Design Methods Part I](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/aLQa4c).
