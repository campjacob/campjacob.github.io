## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

## Unit Resources

You are encouraged to check out the [2022 Spring SOWK 487 Course Syllabus](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=19d91803-e0b4-43b0-b21b-08bb7943cc23).

During many of the classes this semester, you will sometimes need things for our group activities. I generally provide these if we are in person, but if we aren't will modify the activity so we can do it online. In general, as I have facilitated this class over the years, it has always been in person. For the first couple of weeks at least, we will be online only. It is my hope to be in person when we can. Because this is a groups class, it has always been my goal to provide you with activities that you could in the future implement with groups of your own. My intention is to try to adapt as many of these to an online format and then talk about how you could facilitate them in person. Each week in this email, if there are things you need, I will list them here. If you are unable to obtain any of the items, it is ok. They should not be expensive items, but I don't want these activities to make anybody feel like it is a strain. Please do not worry if you do not get the items (or even forget), but I hope it is useful. This week, the only thing you need is

- Some M&M's. Generally, any candies or items that are red, green, yellow, orange, brown, and blue. Furthermore, a partial package will serve our purpose.
