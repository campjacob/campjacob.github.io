I have the forums for this week set up for you now.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week six is synchronous with an in-person session taking place on Saturday (10/04). Students will read chapter nine of Hepworth et al. (2023), which continues to explore assessment, examining individual and environmental factors and their impact on our clients. In the forums, students have the opportunity to reflect on the assessment process and their own biases. I am still working on the exact plan for our in-person class session and will share the agenda and slides later this week.

Some of the learning objectives for this week include:

- Reflect on the role of self-concept, implicit bias, and cultural humility in assessment practices.
- Critically evaluate sample assessment tools and documentation practices.
- Demonstrate understanding of various domains of client functioning and formulate targeted assessment approaches for each.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 9 _Assessing Individual and Environmental Factors and Their Interactions_

**A-02 W-06 Asynchronous Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are four forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- Students can reflect on some of the content from the textbook in [Chapter Nine Content Discussion](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-06_929-105.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=0064053b-85ab-4090-9067-4d532bf7eeb0).
- In [Exploring and Reflection on our Implicit Bias](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-06_929-105.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=1381e9ac-c7c9-4f0f-9326-c60465a8b450), I ask students to take an Implicit Association Test and examine their own biases, using the IMPLICIT framework as a guide for reflection and future practice strategies.
- A space to share and analyze [Examples of Assessment Forms](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-06_929-105.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=12d23eec-81bc-4cad-9f44-f2fa3557d8ff) provides a forum to look at the practical implementation of assessments through how we document them.
- In [What Do We Assess for in Various Areas of Potential Needs](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/🏫_W-06_929-105.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=ce5b754c-0f53-4c67-b2a4-9d53a9f86a6f), students choose a specific assessment area and explore the types of questions, tools, and contextual knowledge needed to gather meaningful information.

**A-03 Reading Quiz**

Complete [W-06 Hepworth et al. (2023) Chapter 09](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=4d88d27f-20ca-4001-96c5-f70c12f697bd) due by Saturday 10/4, 8:00 AM.
