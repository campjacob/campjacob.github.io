I hope that you are all enjoying the snow. I tried to take my kids sledding, but there wasn't quite enough. As well, this last weekend was pretty busy for me. Generally I have had to go to California for the intensive for my Ph.D. program, but with COVID-19 we held it virtually and so I got to participate in that. I'm really looking forward to class this week, and think we have some good things planned. The readings are really good as well.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week three students read through chapters four, five, and six of the Garvin textbook. These include chapters focused on Brenton (2017) and empowerment perspective in groups, Barksy and Northern (2017) and ethics and values in group work, and finally, Ortega (2017) social justice practice. To start the class session, we will be completing an activity to demonstrate power dynamics, talk about empowerment perspective, and do an activity related to social justice.
