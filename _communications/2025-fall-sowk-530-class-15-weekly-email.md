Last week of your first semester! Hope you all are doing well!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 15 is the last week of class. Students will read Hepworth et al. (2023) which reviews methods for evaluating case progress, describes various factors that affect the termination process, identifies relevant tasks for both social workers and clients, and discusses skills essential to effectively managing termination. There are forums to reflect on the reading, to ask questions about students final papers, to engage in the termination process with this class and to reflect on professional resilience.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

**A-05: Family Treatment Modality Research Paper**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 100 pts (20% of final grade); _Deadline_ Monday <s>12/01/25</s> **12/08/25** at 08:00 AM; _Completion_ via MyHeritage Assignments; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=4c05eb27-1be6-4057-8fe6-170012baed3f) and [Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=e87b2bb1-ac95-46f7-92b7-b84fdc168b13);

**Purpose**: This assignment aims for students to research a given topic to understand the empirical evidence around a specific modality of family treatment. Students will improve their ability to find and understand peer-reviewed research journals and use scholarly writing techniques. The research paper opens up a suitable occasion for students to practice their scholarly writing skills.

**Task**: Working individually, students will complete a research paper regarding an evidence-based treatment modality for working with families and or couples. Students may select any intervention. The following are examples of empirically supported family therapeutic interventions: Jim Alexander's Functional Family Therapy, Howard Liddle's Multidimensional Family Therapy, Scott Henggler's Multisystemic Therapy, Jose Szapocznik's Brief Strategic Family Therapy, and Attachment-Based Family Therapy. Students should use strong academic and professional writing skills based on the APA style guide. A title page, abstract, written article, and reference page are all to be included. The following are the expected components:

- **Introduction**: Your paper starts with the title of your paper, and without an additional heading, you should start introducing the context of your paper. You should start by explaining the topic you are considering in a broad manner. This might include identifying the needs of families and couples and explaining the rationale behind the intervention you selected. 
- **History of the Treatment Modality**: You should discuss the intervention's history, including when it was developed and introduced, who the creator(s) of the intervention were, and the context of its development.
- **Treatment Implementation and Common Techniques**: Evidence-based interventions typically involve a series of stages or steps that clinicians follow to implement the intervention. Describe the general process of implementing the modality and give a description of the techniques or strategies used. Provide examples of how a social worker would implement them in practice.
- **Research Findings Regarding Efficacy**: Describe some of the evidence bases of the intervention. Detail at least three studies that showcase its efficacy. Describe some of the key elements (e.g., context, format, participants, outcomes) and results of the studies.
- **Strengths and Limitations**: Report on the strengths and limitations of the given intervention.

**Success**: Students will be assessed on their ability to demonstrate effective scholarly writing. For information, see _Family Treatment Modality Research Paper Rubric_. Students can also earn ten extra credit points toward their final paper grade by demonstrating that they worked with the tutoring services at the Academic Skills Center to review their papers before final submission. Documentation can be emailed to the instructor.

# Family Treatment Modality Research Paper Rubric

The _Family Treatment Modality Research Paper Rubric_ assesses the quality of a submitted research paper based on the paper's organization, the content of the paper, and the inclusion of intervention history, implementation, research basis, strengths, and limitations. Having a paper that engages in effective scholarship and follows the assignment requirements is also required. This rubric is used to assess the _A-05 Family Treatment Modality Research Paper_.
