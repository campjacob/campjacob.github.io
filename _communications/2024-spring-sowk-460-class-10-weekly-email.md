## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

During week ten, we continue to look at design methods. Two common methodologies that we use in developing a program evaluation are qualitative designs and consumer satisfaction. Qualitative design methods provide an opportunity to develop a deep understanding of a perspective or set of perspectives about the organization. Questionnaires and a process to understand consumer satisfaction allow us to understand how our clients are engaging with a service and their perceptions around its implementation.

The agenda for today's session is as follows:

- Presentation about graduation planning
- Benefits of the qualitative approach
- Qualitative design methods
- Focus groups
- Consumer satisfaction surveys
