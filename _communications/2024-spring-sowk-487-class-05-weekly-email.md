I hope that you are all doing well! This week you will get some in-class time to work on your presentations. Bring materials/tools that will facilitate this.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week five, we continue to talk about families, but move to try to understand them in the context of what it looks like across cultural identities and for LGBTQ families. Students read Asakura (2016), and we get the opportunity to talk through the social ecological framework of resilience that she describes for working with LGBTQ families. We also work on some practice activities related to genograms/eco-maps. Students will do an activity exploring various cultural identities and a strategy graphically representing cultural needs. 

The agenda for this week is as follows:

- Time to work on group presentation together
- Considering Genograms/Eco-Maps
- Social-Ecological Framework of Resilience
- Activity to  examine our judgments of others
- Overviews of various cultural groups
- Culturagrams

## Unit Resources

Previous years, I have had students watch [Imagine A World Where Being "Gay" The Norm & Being "Straight" Would Be The Minority!](https://youtu.be/RfBwEChsbSY). If you are still interested in seeing this short mini film on Youtube it can be perspective changing. Just remember, that it could be potentially triggering.

The "Coming Out" Stars activity we did comes from the Trevor Project and you can find it and others in [Empathy and Awareness Activities](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/75ea657f061737b608_6pm6ivozp.pdf)

In talking about genogram's and eco-maps, I share an example that I created when I was in school. You can find the article at [Genogram & Eco-map](https://jacobrcampbell.com/resources/articles/genogram-eco-map). During class we do an activity looking at Mental Health America's resource around [Mental Health Resources For Black, Indigenous, And People Of Color](https://www.mhanational.org/bipoc)

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are are at [Spring 2024 SOWK 487w Week 05 - From Families to Groups and Culturally Competent Social Work Practice](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/MuQdRO).
