I hope you all have a wonderful week and I will see you on Saturday.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week three is synchronous, with class on Saturday (2/7). Students will read about how to apply theory and understanding to organizations. There are forums exploring some questions related to the textbook, applying learning to a case study, and engaging with social justice-related media. I will provide the agenda and slides later this week.

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Kirst-Ashman and Hull (2018) _Chapter 5: Understanding Organizations_

**W-02 A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**: Due to MyHeritage being down on Sunday, I have extended the due dates for the forums from last week to Friday morning. 

**W-03 A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are _three forums_ for this week, and you are expected to make at least **3 replies** across any of the forums and read all of your peers' replies. These forums include the following:

- The [Chapter 5 Discussion Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_531/2526_SP-SOWK_531-0/🏫_W-03_22-28.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=dd96554c-fe9d-405e-9c0a-bd376a5b5baf) forum focuses on concepts from organizational theory and managed care, prompting critical thinking about ethical issues, leadership strategies, and the role of perspective in social reform.
- In the [Learning Organizations Case Study](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_531/2526_SP-SOWK_531-0/🏫_W-03_22-28.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=e80e1a69-d390-48b4-8ac4-4fc229fdf6a7), students assess how to implement a more collaborative and growth-focused model of management within a traditional agency setting.
- [Films for Action Watch and Share](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_531/2526_SP-SOWK_531-0/🏫_W-03_22-28.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=76046bc8-b1fe-41ce-a0da-0df1394cdb7c) encourages exploration of real-world issues through media, asking students to analyze documentaries in light of macro practice theories and organizational structures that affect social justice.
