Have a wonderful week and see you week six!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week five is asynchronous. You will read chapter seven of Royse (2023), which focuses on the range of experimental design methods that can be used to group participants in research. These include experimental, quasi-experimental, and pre-experimental design methods, as well as a discussion of random sampling. In my lecture video, we will discuss writing about an ethical framework and how that can be applied to your final paper and research design. I also ask you to read McDonald et al. (2015) and their discussion of how to write about ethical frameworks in social work. At the start of this week, the group submitted their proposal and group work plan. Students will have the opportunity to provide feedback or ask questions about other groups' projects.

The agenda for the video includes:

- Expectations for week five
- What is an ethical framework
- Ways we consider ethics within program evaluation
- How we would write about ethical frameworks

Learning objectives

- Differentiate between experimental, quasi-experimental, and pre-experimental research designs used in program evaluation.
- Define what an ethical framework is and explain its role in program evaluation design and reporting.
- Critically reflect on contributions to the program evaluation project.
