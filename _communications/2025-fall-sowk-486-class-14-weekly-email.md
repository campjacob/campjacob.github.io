Remember, no class this week. I hope that you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving!!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Due to the Thanksgiving Holidays, we do not have an in-person class this week, and our focus is on introspection about our personal growth and development. We have spent the rest of the semester discussing how we can support, affect change, and understand our client's needs. This week, I want us to turn inward and consider how we do that for ourselves. The following are the objectives I have for you this week.

- Be introduced to the concept of the Wounded healer
- Consider gratitude as a type of self-care
- Consider what you can do to enhance your personal growth as you go through school

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Newcomb et al. (2015) and O'Connell et al. (2018)
- Watch [Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell. (2019)](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0)

**A-01: Class Participation and Engagement**

For week 14, we are just having class online, and I am giving you the opportunity to respond in a couple of forums. My hope and expectation is that you spend some time being introspective this week and write about it. There are three forums open for you to participate in; you don't have to write in all three, but you must post at least two replies across any of the three forums (feel free to post more if you are interested). The following are the three forums:

- First, there is a forum to be able to discuss your own [personal development and education](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2526_FA-SOWK_486W-1/W-14_1124-1130.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=63e6f623-7d27-40b2-a2eb-595cb5823ec3) and what things you have done or want to do to improve yourself.
- Second, it is a forum to discuss the reading and concept of [considering the wounded healer and practice](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2526_FA-SOWK_486W-1/W-14_1124-1130.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=9332e2bc-9e2a-4c2f-a561-191ffd560a43)
- Finally, there is a forum regarding [taking on the perspective of gratitude](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2526_FA-SOWK_486W-1/W-14_1124-1130.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=3eb85dbb-b03a-4499-8bad-6859fd70c892)

Your posts are due by 8 am on Monday, 12/01/25.

**Assignment 04: Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play and Reflection Paper**

Worth 200 points, or 50% of the student's final grade, the assignment has two parts, each worth 100 points. The _Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play_ is a key assignment[^1] for the social work program. This assignment allows you to view yourself as a social worker conducting an interview. The _Interviewing Skills Reflection Paper_ provides a space to self-critique your engagement and interviewing skills.

[^1]: Heritage University's social work program selects assignments across the curriculum for students to demonstrate each of the practice behaviors defined by the CSWE to act as key assignments. These assignments are submitted to Heritage's online portfolio, Anthology Portfolio, and given to all students at each site using the same grading rubric. Student scores help provide data for faculty to self-evaluate the program.

**Assignment 04b: Interviewing Skills Reflective Paper**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 100 pts (25% of student's final grade); _Deadline_ Monday 12/01/25 at 08:00 AM; _Submission_ via Assignments section of My Heritage; _Locations_ [MyHeritage Assignment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2526_FA-SOWK_486W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=163e8d57-4a5f-477a-8ec6-4e6fef48d480), [Syllabus Assignment Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=aa0df4fd-3840-4977-86b5-c811224eb56d);

**Purpose**:  The _Interviewing Skills Reflective Paper_ offers students a chance to reflect on the experience of their role-play after having watched themselves using a critical eye, increasing students' self-reflection. 

**Task**:  After students have completed their role-play and had an opportunity to review their performance, they will individually author a reflective paper describing their experience and what they learned. The reflection should be between 500 and 750 words long, formatted using the APA 7th edition style guide. Abstracts are optional, and if your paper does not cite any sources, there is no need for a reference page. Students must include the following in their writing:

- **Areas of Strengths**: The paper should discuss your areas of strength demonstrated in the role-play. For example, "I used attentive body language because I leaned in slightly and maintained eye contact." Be specific about what went well. Include quotes from either party.
- **Areas for Improvement**: The paper should also discuss your areas for improvement. Again, be specific and use concrete language. State how you will work on these skills.

**Success**:  Students will submit a paper demonstrating their ability to self-reflect and write using strong academic writing skills. Grades are assigned based on the _Reflective Paper Rubric_. Feedback from the instructor will be completed by final Grades, due Wednesday, 12/17/25, at 5:00 PM.

**Reflective Paper Rubric**

The _Reflective Paper Rubric_ is used to evaluate written reflective-style papers. The rubric assesses students based on the following aspects: paper content, professionalism, spelling, grammar, timeliness, and length. The following assignments in this course will be graded according to the reflective paper rubric: _A-04b – Video Role Reflective Paper_ and A-_05a – Empathetic Communication Self-Evaluation Reflective Paper_.

## Unit Resources

In thinking about being introspective, I want students to consider gratitude. I am including a powerful YouTube video by Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell titled [An Antidote to Dissatisfaction](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0) as an assignment this week.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPPPFqsECz0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I have provided two journal articles as handouts for you to read. First, O'Connell et al. (2018) share context for the use of gratitude in a counseling setting. The second is related to Jung's concept of the wounded healer and how it can provide insight and guidance into the impact of entering social work as a wounded healer (Newcomb et al., 2015).

Make sure you have a wonderful break.
