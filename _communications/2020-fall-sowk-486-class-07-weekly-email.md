I hope that you are all having a great weekend. I know this week will be busy, but should still be really good!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week seven and the topic of counterproductive communication builds on week six, which generally looks at just skills related to communication. Communication happens all of the time, and through both verbal and nonverbal patterns. As social workers, we have an obligation to look at how we are communicating and make an attempt to not be putting up barriers to have communication flow freely. The agenda for class this week is as follows:

- Nonverbal communication
- Verbal communication
- Review and practice with some furthering skills
- Barriers to communication

## Unit Resources

## Unit Assignments

### A-01: Synchronous Class Engagement

Attend the Zoom class

### A–02: Asynchronous Class Engagement - Communication Skills Teach-Back Video Post

See description in the forum, assignment, or in previous weeks course plan. Just not reposting the same text in this place. 

### A-02: Asynchronous Class Engagement - W-07 "My Counterproductive communication" FlipGrid

**Purpose**: To provide student the opportunity to be self-reflective and authentic with their own communication patterns.

**Task**: During class 10/05/20 we will talk about 12 different barriers in communication (Gordon & Burch, 2003). These are highly connected and similar to the seven Hepworth et al (2017) discusses. Students are to post a video to flip grid sharing about how they sometimes fall into counter productive communication patters. You do not need to be overly personal, but it is helpful for everybody to recognize that we can improve our communication patterns. Please consider sharing any of the following, you do not have to go though all of the points:

- What counterproductive communication pattern you do
- How have you seen counterproductive communication impact a conversation
- A personal story about counterproductive communication in your life
- A way that you try to use positive communication patters in your life

**Criteria for Success**: Students will post a video that shows that they are able to self-reflect on their communication patters and be authentic ways they can improve.

### Assignment 03: Reading Quiz

Complete the reading quiz for chapter seven prior to class

### Assignment 04: Theory and Practice Integrative Paper

Remember that only one member of you group needs to submit the assignment. When I give feedback I'll submit the feedback to both of you.

**Meta**: Points 100 pts (25% of final grade); Deadline Friday 10/09/20 at 11:55 PM; Submission via My Heritage Assignments.

**Purpose**: Students show the integration of theories of practice to their real-world implementation through the assigned Theory and Practice Integrative Paper. Students work a partner to describe a theory of practice, a fictional client and the implementation of direct practice with a client. 

**Task**: Working in groups of two, students will author a paper that both describes a theory of practice and how a practitioner would implement it working with an individual client. Students are permitted to choose any general social work theory that they would like to discuss. Some major examples of this include systems theory, ecological perspective, strengths perspective, feminist perspective, and other theories out of human behavior and the social environment. Students should approach this paper creatively including the following minimum parts:

- APA formatting in both strong academic writing (e.g. tone, word choice, writing perspective) and paper style (paper sections, headers and footers, page layout, and spacing) 
- Description of the theory examined using peer-reviewed academic journal articles (must use both in-text citations and a reference list).
- Discussion of a fictional client and their circumstances.
- Application of the theory to direct practice actions a clinician would use.

**Criterion for Success**: Successful papers are evaluated using the APA Research Paper Rubric which includes the assessment of the paper content, APA formatting, spelling, grammar, timeliness, and length. Each paper should be between 1,250 and 1,500 words in length. Feedback from the instructor will be completed by no later than mid-term grades due by the faculty on 10/20/20 at 5:00 PM.
