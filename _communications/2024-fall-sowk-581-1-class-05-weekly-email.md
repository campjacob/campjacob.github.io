Week five is a synchronous class week. We will meet on Saturday (09/21/24) to discuss understanding and using the DSM-5-TR. I will share the slides on MyHeritage as we approach class. Please also make sure that you bring your DSM with you.

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Segal et al. (2019) Basics and Beyond in Clinical and Diagnostic Interviewing

**Watch**

- Kinter (2020) Introduction to the DSM-5

**Weekly Online Discussion Forums**

This week, there are three discussion forums for you to engage in. I want you to make a total of **two replies** across any of the forums before class this Saturday. The following is a brief overview of the forums for this week:

- The forum, [thoughts and findings about the diagnostic process](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/üè´_W-05_916_-_922.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=f5095ead-6b9a-4b2e-838f-fefe857c6dad), asks students to consider the reading provided this week and share some of their thoughts.
- In an effort to expose students to an overview of the DSM's content, [Findings Looking into the Content of the DSM](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/üè´_W-05_916_-_922.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=850fea78-a308-4bf6-b316-75583990c685), provides a place to engage with various resources and reflect on that engagement.
- I thought that taking the format of an [AMA - The DMS Edition](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/üè´_W-05_916_-_922.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=ff761d46-d347-48b4-b732-d22814ef0ce3), might be an interesting way to spend a portion of our class this week. 

## Unit Resources

You don't have any reading from the textbook this week (which also means no reading quiz). I have two sources (and some more in the forums) for you to review this week. First, Segal et al. (2019) describe a diagnostic interview well. It is a book chapter, so it is a bit longer, but I think it is valuable and additive to the information offered in your textbook. There are some really good discussions about emerging and new clinicians that I think could be helpful. 

I would like you to watch Kinter (2020). I went down the rabbit hole as I was preparing, looking for a good overview view for you to watch. I like the presentation that Klinter offers. Its is broad, but with some interesting specifics for different areas of diagnosis. In one of the forums, I share some other potential sources for students to look at. His video is only 30 minutes long and covers most of the areas of the DSM. I will say that it is the DSM-5, not the DSM-5-TR, so even some of the changes he talks about have changed again since (consider substance use disorders), but I think it provides some good considerations. See [Introduction to the DSM-5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxpKi7zMqr8).
