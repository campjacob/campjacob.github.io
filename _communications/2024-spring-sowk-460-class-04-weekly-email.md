I hope you are all doing well. I will see you guys in-person for class tonight. There is no reading quiz this week. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Continuing the discussion of program evaluation and ethics and how to write ethical frameworks is the focus of week four. We will examine ethical considerations and frameworks with program evaluation. Groups will also have time to consider their planned evaluation and develop their group work plans.

The agenda for this week includes the following:

- What is an ethical framework
- Ways we consider ethics within program evaluation
- How we would write about ethical frameworks
- Planning the design of and tasks completion of your evaluation

## Unit Assignments

**A-01: Class Engagement and Attendance**

**A-04b: Group Work Plan for the Program Evaluation**

**Purpose**:  The group work plan is a form that students will complete to document their action steps and assignments for completing the program evaluation. 

**Task**:  Groups will develop a work plan that explains the sequence and tasks to be completed for the program evaluation. It should include information regarding evaluation design and data collection with tasks and deadlines assigned to group members. A potential template is available in MyHeritage for students to use.

**Success**:  One group member will post the finalized work plan to the assigned MyHeritage Forum. Student grades will be assessed based on the plan's completeness, clarity, fairness, and feasibility. See Appendix A for the rubric. Feedback for this assignment will be completed by mid-term grades submission, which is due by the faculty on Wednesday 03/20/24 at 5:00 PM.

## Unit Resources

During class, we will be drawing on some information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They have a lot of great information for [developing program evaluation](https://www.cdc.gov/evaluation/index.htm) and [their approach to evaluation](https://www.cdc.gov/evaluation/approach/index.htm) that students could review to gain a deeper understanding. During class, we will spend some time reviewing [McDonald et al. (2015)](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=b5fa349b-5b2c-49bb-bb6d-6d7b0ce0383b).
