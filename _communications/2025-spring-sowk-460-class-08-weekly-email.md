I hope you are all doing well and had a wonderful weekend. Many of you are presenting to the juniors for the first part of class this week. If you told Alicia you would do that, you still need to do it. I'm making a shift for our class time this Monday. It is going to be an optional program evaluation support workshop. I will be in class and will be happy to support you as much as possible. It is a great time to work on your projects.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

I'm changing up the schedule this week. The reading from Royse (2023) is focused on surveys and instrumentation for collecting data. In week six, we spent time exploring surveys and some of the content from the textbook. We will do our Peer Reviews for your group logic models after we get back from Spring Break. I recorded a lecture video to talk through finding academic sources. On Monday, I am offering a program evaluation support workshop where our time will informally support anything you need for your program evaluations.

For my lecture video, the following was my agenda:

- Plan for week eight
- Tips for searching
- Demo example using topic of burnout
