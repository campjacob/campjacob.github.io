## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Coming soon

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Jarolmen and Batista-Thomas (2023) Section 1 of _Chapter 9: Engagement, Assessment, and Intervention Skills in the School for Individuals_

I wanted to offer an opportunity for extra credit in this class. The forums this week are worth extra credit. There is one forum, so no small groups or required synthesis. The focus of this week is on what the _Professional Transitions to Public Schools Coursework Requirement_ (2021, see WAC 181-79A-224), calls scientifically-based practices. We often refer to this as evidence-based practices. Students engaging in the weeks forums are to make at **least three replies**. The forum prompts invite students to reflect on key aspects of school social work practice outlined by Jarolmen and Bautista-Thomas (2023), including the stages of intervention and the application of evidence-based practices like CBT, motivational interviewing, trauma treatment, and solution-focused approaches for various student needs. Participants are encouraged to connect theory to practice by sharing experiences, analyzing feasibility and cultural considerations, offering resources, and exploring real or hypothetical student cases.
