I just sent an email for social work in schools. This is your reminder to also complete you evaluations for seminar and practicum. for Seminar (e.g., SOWK 591) I have *4* and for Practicum (e.g., SOWK 596) I have *5* of the expected 13. I'm not sure who did practicum but not seminar... but please do both of them. They close tomorrow (e.g. the 21st) but tell yourself in your mind that they close 10 minutes after you read this email so you don't procrastinate.

You also need to complete your [2025 Practicum Student Evaluation](https://forms.office.com/r/qX2yXdQZhV). Instead of sending you all a PDF for you to print, write on, and return, I made an easy form that should just take a couple of minutes to complete. I only have one response for that one so far.
