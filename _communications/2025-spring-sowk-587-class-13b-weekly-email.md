I've added video for this week. See the links to the slides and the video below. I also followed up with some of the people planning the graduation celebration events in Toppenish and Tri-cities. I'm still waiting to hear back about what is happening in Toppenish, but in Tri-Cities I know they are planning on including you all in the event. I've made arrangements so that I will be able to both of them (although I'll be a little bit late for the the Toppenish one). 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In Week 13, we return our focus to direct practice with individuals, a core component of school social work. This unit explores assessment and intervention skills, emphasizing specialized modalities such as restorative justice, play therapy, and Hip Hop Therapy. Through reflective discussion and case-based application, students will deepen their understanding of how to engage students. This week, students also submit their larger assignment. In this Social Policy Macro Issue paper, students will have the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to analyze and make recommendations related to social policies. The lecture video focuses on restorative justice practices in a school context.

The agenda for the lecture video includes:

- Week 13 Activities
- Overview of Restorative Practices and Circle-Based Approaches
- Exploring Proactive and Responsive Circle Formats
- Guidelines and Facilitation Strategies for Restorative Circles

The learning objectives for this week include:

- Identify and describe the core goals and formats of restorative justice circle practices used in school settings.
- Understand the different formats that restorative groups can take.
- Identify and describe direct practice with individuals in a school setting.
- Analyze the application and appropriateness of selected intervention models in school-based contexts.
- Apply intervention strategies to a case study using principles of school social work and ethical decision-making.
- Explore how personal and systemic factors (e.g., trauma, school culture, socioeconomic status) shape individual student behavior and support needs.
- Demonstrate knowledge of how to support the outcomes for all students through strategies such as scientifically-based practices, collaborative teaming, and ethical decision making.

[W-13 Small Group Discussion Forums](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/💻_W-13_414-420.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=5e9067ff-eb0f-4bad-aa0b-97c34d010939)

Working with individuals is a key aspect of school social work. Section II of the chapter nine looks as some specific interventions that can be used in a school setting. You can find what group you are in the [A-02 Group Assignments and Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9ac60a9e-af93-4ffa-a1b8-df0b7f662696) handout. Students must submit at least **three replies** this week in their group's forum. Students are able to direct practice approach with individuals by reflecting on the conceptual frameworks that guide their work. They'll also can choose one intervention from the textbook (e.g., Crisis Intervention, Play Therapy, Hip Hop Therapy) to research and expand upon. Using the case study of Joe, students are asked to apply social work strategies and analyze school-based supports, family engagement, and ethical considerations. Finally, students are encouraged to critically engage with textbook content through prompts exploring intervention use, developmental appropriateness, socioeconomic considerations, and real-world application in field settings.

I want to give you time time to focus on your policy paper, so no synthesis post and just a few replies.

**A-05: Social Policy Macro Issue**

**Meta**:  __Points__ 80 pts (16% of final grade); __Deadline__ Monday 04/21/25 at 08:00 AM; __Completion__ via an upload to MyHeritage Assignments; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=668bd3ac-6bfb-410f-93a9-f4c7ed7b9b89) and [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9067a763-894c-4d82-9342-43a9f3ac229f);

**Purpose**: Students will apply their understanding of social welfare policy to a school-related problem researched for their fact sheet. They will create a policy brief aimed at governmental decision-makers that presents the issue, analyzes its relationship to school culture, and recommends evidence-informed, anti-racist, and anti-oppressive policy solutions grounded in cultural humility.

**Task**: The Social Policy Macro Issue Assignment extends the school-related problem fact sheet. Students will work individually to develop a policy brief related to the topic you researched for the fact sheet. The problem description will include an analysis of school culture. Your audience for the social policy macro issue will be governmental decision-makers. The evaluation of this paper includes an evaluation of practice behaviors related to Competency 5 of the CSWE EPAS. Students will examine social welfare policies at the appropriate levels and provide recommendations for policy changes, and content related to anti-racist and anti-oppressive practices. The paper will include a description of the intersectionality related to the chosen problem area and the population, as well as targeted interventions at least two levels. Discussion of how change will be implemented and the collaboration needed is to be included. The application and impact of cultural humility will be discussed.

The policy brief should include at least the following:

- **Title Page**: Include a title page following APA 7 formatting.
- **Problem Description**: Clearly describe your school-related problem and explain its impact on students and school systems. Support your analysis with credible sources. Explore how intersectionality affects students and/or staff, and examine how school culture influences or sustains the problem. 
- **Policy Analysis**: Examine the current policies related to your school-related problem at local, state, tribal, and/or federal levels. Summarize at least one of these policies and assess the impact on school systems and students. Include an analysis of how these policies address or fall short of meeting the needs of diverse client populations. Make connections to a theory applicable to social policy.
- **Recommendations for Policy Change**: Identify how change can be implemented across at least two system levels (micro, mezzo, macro). Describe the types of collaboration needed, such as partnerships with policymakers, schools, or community organizations.
- **Change Strategy and Collaboration**: Propose specific, actionable policy changes grounded in your analysis. Ensure your recommendations are rooted in anti-racist and anti-oppressive frameworks. Explain how cultural humility informs your understanding of the issue and shapes your policy recommendations.
- **Reference List**: All sources should be cited appropriately in APA style throughout. A reference list using APA formatting should be included.

**Success**:  The _Social Policy Macro Issue Rubric_ assesses students for this assignment. Following the assignment guidelines, students will submit a well-written policy brief. The brief will define a school-related problem, analyze the role of school culture, and critically examine relevant social policies. Students will apply social policy theory in relation to diverse client populations, propose evidence-based policy recommendations rooted in anti-oppressive frameworks, and identify realistic change strategies involving key collaborators. The document should be organized clearly, use a professional tone, and follow APA formatting guidelines.

**Social Policy Macro Issue Rubric**

The _Social Policy Macro Issue Rubric_ is used for the assignment of the same name. It evaluates students by requiring a policy brief defining a school-related problem and analyzing its relationship to school culture. It evaluates students' adherence to Heritage University's specialized practice behaviors for competency five. Students must examine relevant social welfare policies at the local, state, tribal, and/or federal levels, apply social policy theory in the context of diverse client populations, and provide evidence-based recommendations for policy change grounded in anti-oppressive frameworks. The final product should be professional and action-oriented, offering realistic implementation strategies across multiple system levels and identifying key collaborators. Students must demonstrate scholarly integration through appropriate evidence, maintain a clear and logical organization, adhere to APA formatting standards, and follow all assignment requirements.


**Competency 5: Engage in Policy Practice**  
a. Examine social welfare policies at local, state, tribal, and federal levels to summarize best practice recommendations.  
b. Assess social policy theory in the context of practice with diverse client populations and prepare recommendations for policy change.
