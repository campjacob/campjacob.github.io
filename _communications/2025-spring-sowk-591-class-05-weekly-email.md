I am looking forward to seeing you all this weekend. Here is what we are doing for seminar.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week three for SOWK 590 is synchronous, with class on Saturday (02/22/25). Students will reflect on their practicum experience in their journals. During class, we will have a student-led discussion regarding an integrated approach, engage in mindfulness through our senses, and participate in a group reflecting on their practice. The following is the agenda:

- SLED: Integrated Approach
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider taking an integrated approach and how that can be implemented.

## Unit Resources

You will focus on an integrated approach during the student-led discussion. This topic is broad, and there are many different directions that might go, and I'm open to how it is framed and implemented. Last semester, your textbook from SOWK 581 presented their development and connection of different therapeutic interventions as an integrated approach (Cooper & Granucci Lesser, 2022). I'm including some other articles that provide models for integrated services. Rosenwald and Baird (2020) describe how trauma-informed group work and the mutual aid model can be integrated. Finn and Molloy (2021) provide an example of their social work program and how they have taken on an advanced integrated practice model for their program in Montana. You can also check out [Dr. Dan Siegel- On Integration As a Source of Strength](https://youtu.be/0TK62FdzzTs?si=0zqQBujG67UJcSyo) as he provides different ways we integrate individually.

In general, I would define integration as the act or process of combining two or more things to work together as a whole. It is a fascinating topic.
