I'm excited to see you all on Monday! I think we are done with snow, at least for this week. That being said, just a reminder that I follow CBC's guidelines for campus closure. You can see CBC's FAQs on [Inclement Weather](https://www.columbiabasin.edu/live/stay/campus-security-and-safety/inclement-weather.html). So if they close the campus then we do online and I'll send a link. If they don't close then I will be there. I know some of you travel some distance. Just communicate. Next week is going to be asynchronous, but I do think in picking your learning teams for your program evaluation project it is much better if we are all together. See [W-02: 1/22 - 1/28](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2324_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-02_122_-_128.jnz) in the course page.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Program evaluation is an ethical obligation to us as social workers, but also beneficial to staff, agencies, and clients. During week two of this course, we will focus on the why of program evaluation and an overview of the evaluative process. We will also pick our learning teams for the program evaluation you will conduct this semester. The following is the agenda for the class session:

- Why program evaluation as a process
- The steps involved in program evaluation
- Getting settled with the program evaluation assignment
