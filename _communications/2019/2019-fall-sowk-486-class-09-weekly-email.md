I hope that you all have had a wonderful week. Todays class is a lab looking further into assessments. I think it should be pretty good information and practice. This is no assigned reading for this week

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Screeners 
- Social histories
- Genograms & Eco-maps

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
