I hope everybody is doing well. I appologize, but I am going to have **cancel the Tuesday section of SOWK 459 for tonight (11/05/19)**. We canceled the Thursday class last week for Halloween last week and this will give the Tuesday class an opportunity to take a slight break.

Any students from the Tuesday class that would like to attend on Thursday (in the SWL building) are more then welcome to. I will hopefully send you out the slides of the presentation tonight or tomrrow before class. We are talking about quantative research, and it should be a good topic. There is a reading quiz and that will still take place as planned.

If you have friends in the class (especially if you think they don't reguarly check their email) would you message them and make sure that they are aware that there won't be class tonight.

Thank you,
