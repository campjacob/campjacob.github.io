I hope that you are doing well. We will diving further into your literature review. If you have research that you have been compiling so far, it would be helpful to bring it. You will probably want a device that you can read some journal articles on as well.

We are also going to be looking at a paper. If you would like to download it and have a paper copy of it, you can find it by searching in the Heritage Library website. The citation is:

Dondero, M. & Humphries, M. (2016) Planning for the american dream: The college-savings behavior of Asian and Latino foreign-born parents in the United States. _Population Research and Policy Review 35_(6) p. 791-823. doi: 10.1007/s11113-016-9409-x.
