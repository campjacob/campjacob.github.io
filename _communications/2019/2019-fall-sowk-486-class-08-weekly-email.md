I hope that you are all doing well. This week is all about assessments. It should be pretty interesting. We have a lot to cover, but no worries, we have a lab day for the week after to dive more into practicing with the material.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. Don't forget to complete the reading quiz found on the MyHeritage class forum. This week the reading is:

- Hepworth et al. (2017) __Chapters 8 and 9__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Diagnostic Assessments
- DSM-5
- Mini Mental Status Exams

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
