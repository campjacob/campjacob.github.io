I hope that you are all doing well. I'm looking forward to class tonight. We are talking about counterproductive communication patters. I can't remember if we talked about this in class. I will push your due date for your paper to Sunday this week. I'm kind of behind in things right now, and I won't be able to start working on grading it until after this weekend anyways. Before Friday, I'll change the due date in My Heritage.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. Don't forget to complete the reading quiz found on the MyHeritage class forum. This week the reading is:

- Hepworth et al. (2017) __Chapter 7__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Nonverbal communication
- Verbal communication
- Barriers to communication

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
