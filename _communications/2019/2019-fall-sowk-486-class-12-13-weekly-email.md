A reminder that we have a special guest speaker coming this Wednesday, Judy Dirks, M.A., LMHC. She is a [therapist at Therapy Solutions](http://therapy-solutions.us/staff/judy-dirks-m-a-lmhc). She is going to be talking through some of the content in Joan Rosenberg's 2019 book, 90 Seconds to a Life You Love: How to Master Your Difficult Feelings to Cultivate Lasting Confidence, Resilience, and Authenticity. You can find it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Seconds-Life-You-Love-Authenticity/dp/031641431X), the books [website](https://www.90secondsbook.com), or watch her speak on an episode of [Guy Lawrence's podcast](https://youtu.be/u7fKFUKrYzI) on YouTube.
