I hope that you are all well and have been enjoyed the long weekend. I'm looking forward to class this week. This week we will be talking all about ethics.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. Don't forget to complete the reading quiz found on the MyHeritage class forum. This week the reading is:

- DeCarlo (2018) __Chapter 5__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Preparing for peer review process
- Unethical examples
- Tasks and concepts related to ethical social science research methods
- Examples of processes and forms related to ethics

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
