I hope that you are all doing well. We are getting close to the end of the semester. You have your research proposals due this Sunday and then there is one more assignment, your comprehensive papers.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. Don't forget to complete the reading quiz found on the MyHeritage class forum. This week the reading is:

- DeCarlo (2018) __Chapters 15 and 16__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Reminder regarding qualitative verses quantitative examples
- Practice determining a research proposal
- Your research proposal

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
