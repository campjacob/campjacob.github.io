Looking forward to seeing you all this week. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week 15, we are shifting our focus away from treatment groups to task groups. The readings this week focus on interdisciplinary group work. Bronstein (2003) helps us look into interdisciplinary teamwork and the skills and processes necessary to be successful in its implementation. Nancarrow et al. (2013) look at the productive aspects of a team. During class, we will do an activity about organizing our priorities and ethics, as well as a lecture on the learning content for the week. The learning objectives for this week include:

- Be able to explain what a Community-Based Participatory Research Partnerships is and some of the criteria for how we would measure the effectiveness
- Demonstrate and discuss ethical responses in a community practice setting
- Describe what makes for effective interdisciplinary team processes
