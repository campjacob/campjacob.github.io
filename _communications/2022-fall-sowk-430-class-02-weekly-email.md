I hope that you have all enjoyed the first week of class. Let me know if there is any way I can support you!


## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

For week two of SOWK 430, we will be learning and discussing more regarding social work history. I've had a chance to read through much of the discussion from last week's reading in the forums, and I appreciate the engagement in the discussion and people's conversational tone and focus. Great job! It was also great to see all of your introductions in the Flip video discussion app.

Social justice is a core value of social workers ([National Association of Social Workers, 2021](https://www.socialworkers.org/About/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics/Code-of-Ethics-English)). This week you get to watch a documentary about the history of social work. In addition, there are forums where you will be able to discuss various social justice movements in the united state. I've also included many readings you can optionally read to help situate yourself in each movement. Because the documentary I have you watch is about an hour, I am not creating a lecture video for this week.

**Week 02 Objectives:**

- Gain further knowledge of the history of social work
- Learn about several critical social movements

**Aâ€“01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The week two forums have six different forums. **Students are not required to make replies in all of the forums** but can pick and choose which forum they want to complete a response. The replies can either be to the questions posed in each of the forums or your peer's posts. Even though you don't have to make replies in all forums, the expectation is that you will read through the discussion. This week, students must complete at least three replies across any of the six forums.

## Unit Resources

The lecture video this week is a documentary published by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), directed by Offenbach (2001). The documentary [Legacies of Social Change: 100 Years of Professional Social Work in the United States](https://youtu.be/a4VzRSnksmA) can be viewed on YouTube.

For this class, I'm not going to grade forums based on students' use of APA style. However, it is helpful to practice using the APA style, as it will help you as you continue in the social work program. In your forums, you should include [in-text citations](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations) and then for the [reference list entry](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references), you can just write the word reference and list the entries. This is an excellent opportunity to practice looking up how to do these citations. You don't need to worry about making it have a hanging indent, but try to have all of the parts of the entries.
