I'll see you guys tomorrow for class and our presentations. You all will do great!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

We return to the topic of work with families in week seven. Students will complete their presentations and share evidence-based family treatment modalities. They will also start reading a portion of the content from Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs (2014) Section 1, which presents a model for psychoeducational groups. During class, we will look at the empowerment theory in group work and some examples of how this is implemented. The agenda for class this week is as follows:

- Family Treatment Modality Research Presentations
- Empowerment theory and group work
- Midterm Feedback

## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Read Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs (2014) Section 1 

**A-01: Class Engagement and Attendance**

Attend Class

**A-02: Reading Engagement and Check-in Questions**

Complete the reading engagement and check-in questions at [W-07 A-02 Reading Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2425_SP-SOWK_487W-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=44828347-b92e-4b6c-bca7-b35221da4911), which is due Wednesday, 03/05/25 at 5:30 PM. It is a couple of questions about the content in the assigned reading.

**Assignment 03: Family Treatment Modality Research Presentation**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 100 pts (20% of final grade); _Deadline_ Wednesday 03/05/25 during class; _Completion_ Students will complete their group presentations during class; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2425_SP-SOWK_487W-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=c7bf432b-290c-412d-9566-99d2ee22d7c8) and [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=0e19f772-de53-4418-acc3-0013f88596fa).

**Purpose**: This assignment aims for students to research a given topic collaboratively to understand the empirical evidence around a specific modality of family treatment. Students will improve their ability to find and understand peer-reviewed research journals and use scholarly writing techniques. The presentation opens up a suitable occasion for students to practice making an academic presentation and discussing scholarly topics. 

**Task**:  Students will be placed into groups of three or four peers to complete a research project regarding an evidence-based treatment modality for family or marital therapy. Students may select any intervention. The following are examples of empirically supported family therapeutic interventions: Jim Alexander's Functional Family Therapy, Howard Liddle's Multidimensional Family Therapy, Scott Henggler's Multisystemic Therapy, Jose Szapocznik's Brief Strategic Family Therapy, and Attachment-Based Family Therapy. 

The presentation's content would follow a format similar to a written article discussing a therapeutic intervention. It should include at least the following:

- Description and history of the treatment modality
- Treatment implementation and common techniques
- Research findings regarding efficacy
- Strengths and limitations of the selected treatment
- References

The presentation should take approximately 10â€“15 minutes. There is no set minimum number of articles you should draw from (but it should be in the range of 5-10).

**Success**: Students will provide an informative presentation about the therapeutic intervention. See _Appendix A Family Treatment Modality Research Informative Presentation Rubric_ for grading information. I include grades for the assignment in the midterm grades submission, which must be posted by the instructor by Wednesday, 03/26/25 at 5:00 PM.

**Appendix A Family Treatment Modality Informative Presentation Rubric**

The _Family Treatment Modality Research Informative Presentation Rubric_ assesses the quality of a presentation based on organization, content, and delivery. The organization evaluates the alignment with audience needs, topic accuracy, factual information, and logical flow. Content is assessed on the depth of the treatment modality's history, implementation details, efficacy research, and strengths and limitations. Delivery includes using attractive, clear, and additive visual aids, adherence to time limits, and proper citation.

| Description | Initial | Emerging | Developed | Highly Developed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Presentation Organization: (audience, topic, accuracy, and logical sequence) | Zero to one of the four assessed areas fit the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | At least two of the four assessed areas fit the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | At least three assessed areas fit the highly developed standards listed in the rubric. | Audience: The presentation targets a scholarly audience with limited subject knowledge. Topic: accurately follows the requirements described in the syllabus. Accuracy: The information provided is factual and brought from scholarly sources. Logical Sequence: <br>The presentation follows a logical and goal-oriented sequence that provides sufficient context for the audience. |
| Presentation Content: <br>(description and history of the treatment modality) | There is no discussion of the development of the treatment modality. | The presenters mention its development and history without providing meaningful details. | The presentation offers a description of the development of the treatment modality. The intervention creators are mentioned.  | The presentation provides a meaningful description of the history and development of the treatment modality. It helps place it in the context of other treatment options. The intervention's creators are discussed.  |
| Presentation Content: (treatment implementation and common techniques) | There is no discussion of the implementation and common techniques. | The implementation process or the standard techniques are at least mentioned. | The implementation details are described in enough detail to show the general focus of the intervention. Many of the strategies or techniques are described.  | The stages or steps a clinician goes through to implement the intervention are outlined in detail. Many of the strategies or techniques are explained. Some methods are demonstrated or taught to the listeners to provide a real-world application. |
| Presentation Content:<br>(research findings regarding efficacy) | There is no discussion or inclusion of research findings. | There is little explanation of the efficacy of the intervention. The effectiveness is based on only one study. | The presenters discuss at least two studies and the effectiveness of the treatments. The presentation lacks some of the vital information from the studies. | The presenters provide an insightful understanding of the effectiveness of the intervention. A few studies are used to provide the basis for efficacy. The presenters offer key elements of the studies (context, format, participants, outcomes, etc.)<br> <br>  |
| Presentation Content:<br>(strengths and limitations of the selected treatment) | There is no discussion of the strengths or limitations of the treatment. | There is little information provided regarding strengths and limitations.  | The strengths are briefly described in general terms, without using case examples. The limitations are generic. | There is a detailed discussion of the strengths of the given intervention. Potential population and uses are described. The limitations of the interventions are also described. Limitations should include a discussion of what researchers have defined as needing more research regarding this intervention. |

## Unit Resources

Students will read [Circle of Hope: A Guide for Conducting Psychoeducational Support Groups (2nd ed.)](https://www.wcsap.org/sites/default/files/uploads/working_with_survivors/support_groups/Circle_of_Hope_2014.pdf) which is by Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs (2014). They only have to read the first section of the guide.

I really value feedback about how the classes I teach are going. There are two opportunities each semester, in the middle of the semester (e.g., now!) and the end, to provide feedback about the course. I do read this and have an honest desire to be the best teacher I can be. I'd be grateful if you would consider completing the [Spring 2025 Midterm Feedback for SOWK 487 Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=BA87C336-3D36-4861-A385-E14B5EB9F204&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=D0KEKIY306).

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Spring 2025 SOWK 487w Week 07 - Empowerment Groups in Social Work](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/EUA7A8).
