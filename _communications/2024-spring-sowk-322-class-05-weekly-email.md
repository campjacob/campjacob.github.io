I hope you are all having a wonderful week!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week five, we start engaging with the lived experience of persons with disabilities. My lecture video discusses the stages of acceptance of a learning disability (Higgins et al., 2002). Rothman (2018) provides several impactful personal accounts of people with disabilities sharing about the start of their disability, how it progresses, and some of the consequences. During this unit, you will learn the following:

- Identify different time periods in which disability can begin
- Identify variations in the course of the progression of disability
- Identify outcomes associated with disability
- Identify supports that might be available at all stages of onset, course, and outcome

**Aâ€“01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

Students are to make at least three replies across any of the five open forums this week. Remember, the expectation is to read all of the posts. Your responses can include another student's reply if you contribute something substantial to the discussion. Be sure to post on two separate days to show engagement. The following are the five forums this week:

- The forum, [Chapter 8 Reading Discussion Topics](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-05_212_-_218.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=1af38207-d879-4800-a728-34dc421d7b7c), provides four different potential discussion questions that come from the textbook
- There are two articles and a TED talk that are additional materials for this week; the forum [Reflecting on Articles about Supports](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-05_212_-_218.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=197fb281-14f4-44d7-a5a8-db25deab9ac5) gives a space for students to reflect on these sources.
- There are three separate forums to provide a space to talk about supports at [Onset of a Disability](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-05_212_-_218.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=9f3906c0-86ec-439c-9b75-f499560299f3), [During the Course of a Disability](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-05_212_-_218.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=d7189a3a-3205-45e8-bb97-a49f8b5ccdc1), and in [Developing Acceptance Related to Outcome](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-05_212_-_218.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=c5fd17f1-241a-48c2-b5cd-bc032db1221f)

## Unit Resources

For week five you will read a couple of articles. McGill Smith (n.d.) and her article [You Are Not Alone: For Parents When They Learn That Their Child Has a Disability](https://www.parentcenterhub.org/notalone/) gives a good description of what a parent finding out their child has a disability might need to hear. Smith (2023) and her article [Illness and Disability: Living Well with a Disability](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/living-well-with-a-disability.htm) give ideas for how people can learn to cope with their disability. Epler (2018) in her TED Talk [3 ways to be a better ally in the workplace](https://www.ted.com/talks/melinda_briana_epler_3_ways_to_be_a_better_ally_in_the_workplace), gives some great examples of how we can support persons with disabilities.
