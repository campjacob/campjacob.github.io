I hope you all have a wonderful week!!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week six is an asynchronous week, with no in-person class session. We will be exploring multicultural practice, which requires an understanding of theory and practice implementation. This week, students will read about (and take a reading quiz) multicultural practice. They will also look at the NASW and the indicators for cultural competency they lay out for social workers. Students will also be able to consider how cultural factors are assessed within diagnostic interviews.

The Learning Objectives for this Week Include:

- Know the NASW standards for cultural competence
- Practice using tools and strategies for assessing cultural needs
- Understand how multicultural worldviews affect the therapeutic relationship

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 4 Multicultural Practice

I plan on putting out a lecture video, but I still need to finish it. Check back later in the week, and one will be here.

## Unit Resources

Congress and Kung (2012) have a chapter in a book on multicultural practice they wrote describing the use of a culturagram. It isn't too long and provides a good overview of what you would consider for each section. I have attached it as a handout for this week.

To find resources about understanding culture related to a diagnostic interview, check out the resources related to [DSM-5-TR Online Assessment Measures](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures).

The textbook provides a good context for how social workers should think about multicultural practice. I'd like students to also read the National Association of Social Workers' (2015) [Indicators for Cultural Competence in Social Work Practice](https://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=7dVckZAYUmk%3d&portalid=0). Students can also review the inSocialWork Podcast, which you all might consider subscribing to. They have 65 episodes tagged as related to [Diversity/Cultural Competence](https://www.insocialwork.org/category/diversity-cultural-competence/).

`You can find all of the videos for this course in [Lecture Videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/Lecture_Videos.jnz). You can find [Fall 2024 SOWK 581 (0) - Week 06]().`
