Seminar I have a fun activity we will do next weekend.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week nine is synchronous with having class on Saturday (10/19/24) week for SOWK 590. We will have the following agenda:

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider community organizing and activism.

## Unit Resources

Our mindfulness activity we are going to do this week will be to create and use poi for spinning. I participated in an activity related to this at the NASW conference I went to last month and wanted to share it with all of you. You can find some information about the [Flow Arts Institute](https://flowartsinstitute.com/) and  some resources by the presenter [Resources - Sound Connections Counseling and Consulting](https://www.lorisirs.com/resources). You can also see [Poi (performance art) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(performance_art)).

I'll post my slides as we get closer to class.
