**A-01: Class Engagement and Participation**

Students are to make at least three replies across any of the five forums this week. The forums for this week revolve around the _Standards for Technology in Social Work Practice_. There are four sections of the document and there is a corresponding forum to each. These include [Section 1: Provision of Information to the Public](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/W-15_1128-124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=8eb7233e-b7c9-417e-9185-90542b737714), [Section 2: Designing and Delivering Services](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/W-15_1128-124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=08fdabdb-19d8-4736-9182-0a7533a6ff67), [Section 3: Gathering, Managing, and Storing Information](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/W-15_1128-124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=b003a48e-2544-452b-b6ac-4c2f4f9302da), and [Section 4: Social Work Education and Supervision](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/W-15_1128-124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=f445f1a4-e70b-40c4-94a9-3c7b1ad15e92). There is another forum where students can discuss [Social Media and Social Work](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/W-15_1128-124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=344b3d2a-886b-4ea1-9fe4-0a418827d665). 

**A-05: Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Model Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 100 points (16% of total points); _Deadline_ <span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">Sunday 11/27/22</span>; **Friday 12/02/22** _Completion_ via Anthology Portfolio (My Heritage Assignments [A-05: Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Model Paper](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=606f0394-ce3a-4765-a9ba-ad7b674a32aa)). You can find the [Case Study for Final Paper](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=0821bfa4-93eb-495d-afbd-0fc353812685) and a [PDF Version of these instructions with the rubric included](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=f36f98b4-3d23-45fa-bb04-fe4c224e1b89).

**Purpose**: The _Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Model Paper_ allows students to display their skills in applying an ethical framework to a case study.

**Task**: Students will work individually to author a final paper that is 750â€“1000 words in length. The final report should address the first four NASW Essential Steps to Ethical Problems Solving regarding the assigned case study (this can be accessed in the assignment description). Student papers should include headings (APA formats level one heading as bold, centered, and following a title case capitalization style) for each of the first four steps. These steps include: 

1. **DETERMINE** whether there is an ethical issue or/and dilemma. Is there a conflict of values, rights, or professional responsibilities? 
2. **IDENTIFY** the key values and principles involved. What meanings and limitations are typically attached to these competing values? 
3. **RANK** the values or ethical principles that are most relevant to the issue or dilemma in your professional judgment. What reasons can you provide for prioritizing one competing value/principle over another? 
4. **DEVELOP** an action plan consistent with the ethical priorities that have been determined as central to the dilemma. As appropriate, have you conferred with clients and colleagues about the potential risks and consequences of alternative courses of action? Can you support or justify your action plan with the values/principles on which the intervention is based?

This assignment is a key assignment[^1] for the program. It is designed to assess students' ethical and professional behavior, the first competency described by the Council on Social Work Education. The following is the language used in the 2022 education and policy standards (EPAS):

[^1]: Heritage University's social work program selects assignments across the curriculum for students to demonstrate each of the practice behaviors defined by the CSWE to act as key assignments. These assignments are submitted to Heritage's online portfolio, Anthology Portfolio, and given to all students at each site using the same grading rubric. Student scores help provide data for faculty to self-evaluate the program.


> Competency 1: Demonstrate Ethical and Professional Behavior
> 
> Social workers understand the value base of the profession and its ethical standards, as well as relevant policies, laws, and regulations that may affect practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Social workers understand that ethics are informed by principles of human rights and apply them toward realizing social, racial, economic, and environmental justice in their practice. Social workers understand frameworks of ethical decision making and apply principles of critical thinking to those frameworks in practice, research, and policy arenas. Social workers recognize and manage personal values and the distinction between personal and professional values. Social workers understand how their evolving worldview, personal experiences, and affective reactions influence their professional judgment and behavior. Social workers take measures to care for themselves professionally and personally, understanding that self-care is paramount for competent and ethical social work practice. Social workers use rights-based, anti-racist, and anti-oppressive lenses to understand and critique the profession's history, mission, roles, and responsibilities and recognize historical and current contexts of oppression in shaping institutions and social work. Social workers understand the role of other professionals when engaged in interprofessional practice. Social workers recognize the importance of lifelong learning and are committed to continually updating their skills to ensure relevant and effective practice. Social workers understand digital technology and the ethical use of technology in social work practice.
> 
> Social workers:
> 
> a. make ethical decisions by applying the standards of the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics, relevant laws and regulations, models for ethical decision making, ethical conduct of research, and additional codes of ethics within the profession as appropriate to the context;
> b. demonstrate professional behavior; appearance; and oral, written, and electronic communication;
> c. use technology ethically and appropriately to facilitate practice outcomes; and
> d. use supervision and consultation to guide professional judgment and behavior. (pp. 8-9)

**Success**: Successful papers are evaluated using the _Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Model Rubric_, which includes assessing the student's ability to implement the ethical decision-making model, expressing a connection to the CSWE 2022 competency one practice behavior, and writing proficiency. Feedback from the instructor will be included in the final grades, due by the facility no later than Wednesday 12/14/22 at 5:00 PM.


**A-06a: [Extra Credit] Bias Testing Reflective Paper**

The faculty for this course offers students two different opportunities for extra credit. The first is a minor assignment for participating in the Implicit Association Test from Harvard (or a similar test for bias) and reflecting on your findings. The second is a more intensive research paper discussing the historical context of social work. These assignments are extra credit and not mandatory. This description is for the more minor assignment.

**Meta**: _Points_ 31.25 (5% of total points); _Deadline_ Friday 12/02/22 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ via My Heritage Assignments ([A-06a: [Extra Credit] Bias Testing Reflective Paper](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=ba543431-92eb-465f-944a-8899e79333d2)) as an uploaded document. You can also see a [PDF copy of the assignment instructions and rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=bebab4ed-be56-44e7-84f9-d56736f9c3a1).

**Purpose**: The Bias Testing Reflective Paper provides an avenue for students to self-reflect on their own biases after completing a bias testing process.

**Task**: Students will participate in [Harvard's Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) and write a reflective paper 500 to 750 words in length. They will consider their experience with the test, their results, and what they might be able to learn from the experience.

**Success**: Students will submit a paper demonstrating strong academic writing and self-reflective skills. Essays are graded according to the Reflective Paper Rubric. Feedback will be provided with final grades due by the instructor no later than Wednesday 12/14/22 at 5:00 PM.


**A-06b: [Extra Credit] Social Work Historical Context Research Paper**

The faculty for this course offers students two different opportunities for extra credit. The first is a minor assignment for participating in the Implicit Association Test from Harvard (or a similar test for bias) and reflecting on your findings. The second is a more intensive research paper discussing the historical context of social work. These assignments are extra credit and not mandatory. This description is for the more major assignment.

**Meta**: _Points_ 62.5 (10% of total points); _Deadline_ Friday 12/02/22 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ via My Heritage Assignments ([A-06b: [Extra Credit] Social Work Historical Context Research Paper](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=90bfce50-f20b-42df-8628-7a96b9d91000)) as an uploaded document. You can also see a [PDF copy of the assignment instructions and rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=a67350a2-6956-4b05-9308-194b6187dbc0).

**Purpose**: The _Social Work Historical Context Research Paper_ allows students to dive into the literature on social work history.

**Task**: Students will individually author a paper regarding some aspect of social work history. This is left intentionally broad to allow students to look at any element they want. Some potential suggestions include when and how various populations started engaging in social work (consider how social work historically related to Native Americans, persons with disabilities, or the start of social workers working in a school-based setting. The paper should be approximately 1,250 to 1,500 words in length. An abstract is not necessary for this paper but may be included.

**Success**: Students will submit a paper demonstrating academic skills describing the historical context for social work through research found in peer-reviewed journal articles. They will be able to demonstrate scientific writing skills. Grades will be assessed using the APA Research Paper Rubric. Feedback will be provided with final grades due by the instructor no later than Wednesday 12/14/22 at 5:00 PM.
