I hope that you are all well. This is just a reminder that we **DO NOT** have class tonight. When I was initially planning this semester and the syllabus, I had put today as veterans day. Last week, I realized that today is not, in-fact veterans day, but it is this Wednesday this week (11/11/20). 

It is an excellent opportunity to consider our veterans. I know I have been. My uncle, a Vietnam war veteran, died this last week. I'm going down to Bend this weekend to celebrate his life and for a memorial service. I hope you all have a wonderful week.

There is not any asynchronous work that must be completed for this week. If you are doing either the extra credit assignments, they are due on Friday. The video role-play assignment is expected next week.
