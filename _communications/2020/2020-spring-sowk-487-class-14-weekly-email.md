I hope that you are all doing well. A reminder that we have class tonight, and the link is found at [https://zoom.us/j/9195559027](https://zoom.us/j/9195559027). It is useful if you have read chapters Garvin et al. (2017) Chapters 24 and 26. There is a handout that we will be using [Ethical Dilemmas in Macro Social Work Practice](https://jacobrcampbell.com/assets/media/2020-sowk-487-ethical-dilemmas-in-macro-social-work-practice.pdf). You can also see the presentation slides that we will be covering. There are several activities that we will be doing in breakout sessions.
