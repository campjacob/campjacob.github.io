### Assignment 05a: Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play

You can find the Forum on the sidebar, connected to the assignments page or [directly](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2021_FA-SOWK_486W-2/Assignment_5a_Forum.jnz)

<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><strong>Remember, each one of you have to spend about 10 minutes being the interviewer, then debrief. If you videos are separated, you can each post the video that has you being the interviewer. If your videos are combined (e.g., both you you being the interviewer are on the same link, just one of you have to post.</strong></p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><strong>Meta</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Points</em>&nbsp;100 pts (20% of student&rsquo;s final grade);&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;<del><span style="color: #ff0000;">11/13/20</span></del>&nbsp;<strong>11/20/20</strong>&nbsp;by 11:55 PM;&nbsp;<em>Submission</em>&nbsp;Student&rsquo;s will post a forum that can be found in the assignments of MyHeritage.</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><strong>Purpose</strong>: The&nbsp;<em>Interviewing Skills Video Role-Play</em> supports students in confirming acquisition of interviewing skills (application of person in the environment, empathetic responding, reflective responding, and other interpersonal skills).</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><strong>Task</strong>: Students will work with a partner to record a 10 to 15-minute interview with a partner. The interview should be of an initial meeting with a social worker and a fictional client. Students have the freedom to develop their own setting for the interview. This assignment is designed to offer the student the opportunity to demonstrate competency six, which is &ldquo;engage with individuals, families, groups, organizations and communities&rdquo; (CSWE, 2015, p. 8). The following is the language used in education and policy standards for the CSWE (2015):</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Social workers understand that engagement is an ongoing component of the dynamic and interactive process of social work practice with and on behalf of diverse individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Social workers value the importance of human relationships. Social workers understand theories of human behavior and the social environment, and critically evaluate and apply this knowledge to facilitate engagement with clients and constituencies, including individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Social workers understand strategies to engage diverse clients and constituencies to advance practice effectiveness.</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Apply knowledge of human behavior and the social environment, person-in-environment, and other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks to engage with clients and constituents.</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Use empathy, reflection, and interpersonal skills to effectively engage diverse clients and constituencies (pp 8&ndash;9).</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">The following are the instructions for this assignment:</p>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Students will record a 10 to 15-minute role-play with a classmate. There are two general formats students can complete this activity with. To complete this in-person, students would use a tripod or stable surface to record the role-play or for a distance version students would use zoom or another online meeting service to record a role-play.</p>
<ul style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">
<li>Each role-play will have three parts (a) introduce the role-play setting, (b) completion the client interview using listening and attending skills discussed and practiced in class, and (c) debrief with role-play with your partner.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">
<li>
<p>The intention is demonstrating your ability to use attentive listening, open ended questions, empathetic responding, and other skills. The focus is not on solving the persons problem or difficulties.</p>
</li>
<li>Each of the three parts can be done with the camera rolling. During the debrief with your partner discuss (a) the things that you said/did that helped the other person feel comfortable and open up, and (b) The things that could have been improved, and (c) any suggestions or feedback from your partner.</li>
<li>
<p>After completing the first interview, switch roles and do another 10 to 15-minute role play following the same format.</p>
</li>
<li>Save the video to a cloud service that will allow you to share a link or embed the video on My Heritage. Most students upload the video to a YouTube account. Students can upload it as &ldquo;unlisted,&rdquo; which means that it will not show up in YouTube searches. Please make sure that it is not set to private, or the instructor will not be able to see it. Additionally, your video can also be saved to OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, or any cloud sharing that allows you to share a link to the video as a way of submitting the assignment.</li>
<li>
<p>Share the link to the video (or embed the video) on My Heritage in the appropriate forum. Make sure to provide a brief description of what you are sharing (e.g. who is in it, what the setting is).</p>
</li>
<li>You may watch other students video presentations; replies are not required for this discussion forum.</li>
</ul>
<p style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><strong>Criteria for Success</strong>: Each student will submit a video of themselves that demonstrates their use of interviewing skills. Grades will be based on the&nbsp;<em>Practice Behaviors Rubric</em>&nbsp;which evaluates students based on assess the CSWE competency six and the&nbsp;<em>Engagement and Micro Skills Role-Play Rubric</em>&nbsp;which evaluates students regarding the actual role-play video looking at content, organization, and skills. Feedback from the instructor will be completed by no later than Sunday 12/06/20.</p>
