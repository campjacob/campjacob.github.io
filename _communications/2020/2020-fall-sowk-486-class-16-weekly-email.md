It's finals week finally. I am still busy grading your fanal work, and don't see any way I will be done before class tonight. We talked previously about wanting to meet one more time this semester and that is tonight at 5:30. It should be informal, and allow us to check in and celebrate the end of the your first semester at Heritage.
