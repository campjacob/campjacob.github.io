I hope that all of you are out there staying safe. I know there is a ton of disruption in all of our lives. I think that the rest of the semester should still be useful for learning about group work and social work. I want to be able to support all of you. I would love the opportunity to talk to you all individually, and if you are interested, text (509) 392-1056 or email me campbell_j@heritage.edu a time that you would like to meet in the next week or two over Zoom or FaceTime. I'd like just to hear how everybody is doing in these difficult times.

I'm assuming one of the big questions If your group is unsure about moving forward with your group facilitation project. If you have already completed your group facilitation, you can just go forward as normal (write a reflection paper and giving your peers feedback). My assumption is that most of you / all of you have not completed it it. I'm offering a replacement assignment for this activity. Even seniors who were at their practicum (if there practicum was still open) are not able to attend anymore this year. If you have not completed the group facilitation project and haven't already done so you should contact the organization and let them know you are no longer going to be able to move forward doing this. The replacement assignment will be an online presentation. You will research some aspect of doing group work and create a presentation regarding it. You will submit a video of the presentation using zoom or Panopto and your classmates will all be able to see and make some comments. As for the specific topic, it can be any aspect of working with groups. For example, if you are interested in groups with saviviors of domestic violence, then you might talk about special considerations in working with this population. You might do a presentation about evidence-based practices for a specific population, or some helpful strategies in facilitating a group. We will talk more about this in our online zoom class.

The following are some of the changes to the plan for the rest of the semester. We will be meeting online on Zoom. Links below (each week through the weekly email, I will also send out the link, but thought it might be helpful to have it all in one place). I will also send out calendar invites so that it is in your calendar through your Heritage email. The invitation will have the links and methods to connect. You just click the link when it is time for class to start, and it is pretty easy to join.

Zoom works on a computer, tablet, or phone. It will let us see each other. We can have break out room discussions (e.g., small groups). I've not facilitated many meetings using it yet, but I'm sure we will all become experts. One consideration to take is to keep your microphone on mute when you aren't talking. It is straightforward to take on and off. I know for some of us, video chat is a little awkward, but if you can have your camera set up, it is helpful to "see" everybody.

All of the zoom session are set up under my the same URL, [https://zoom.us/j/9195559027](https://zoom.us/j/9195559027).
