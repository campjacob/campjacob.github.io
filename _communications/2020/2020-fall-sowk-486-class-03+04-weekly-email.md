I hope that you are all well. The smoke this weekend has been pretty horrendous. I'm thankful to not be in Oregon or closer to the actual fires. It is still so bad.

We are getting ready to go into week four. Tonight you should have posted for week three in Flipgrid (there have only been two posts so far that you have had to do there (I know the title is different than the syllabus..., but it's the week three one). You should also be finishing up reading chapters one and two in the textbook. There is a quiz (navigate to assignments in My Heritage and the link is there) that you have to complete before class this Monday.   

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week four of SOWK 486 is about understanding what direct social work practice and some of what makes social workers unique in our helping style. We will start with an exercise, considering how you have been helped in the past.  Many clients we work with as social workers a mandated to participate in services and involuntary in some manner. We will discuss how to engage with them through some best practices. The agenda for the session is as follows:

- How we help
- Evidence-based practice
- Involuntary clients
- Ecological Systems Model
- Social work jobs and roles

## Unit Resources

In your ethics class, you will likely read the entire code of ethics, but it is useful to read through it and familiarize yourself with the values and expectations of being a social worker. You can find it online [National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics](https://www.socialworkers.org/about/ethics/code-of-ethics).

I post all of the presentations online at [presentations.jacobrcampbell.com](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com). You can find the presentation for [Week 04: Direct Social Work Practice](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/Ukelst)

We are going to talk about the roles that social workers take on today. I made a video a while back, [The 15 Hats (ahem, Roles) of Social Workers](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/02/the-15-hats-ahem-roles-of-social-workers/), that also talks about this if you want to use that as a primer.

## Unit Assignments

This week the following are your assignments for you to complete the reading quiz for chapters one and two. These are to be completed before class on Monday and can be found in the assignments. Feel free to work in groups or go at your own pace. The answers/results of the quiz will be released on Monday after the class has started. Feel free to ask about the quiz if you questions.

For your asynchronous class engagement, you have a discussion forum that you will be completing. 

**Meta**: Students will complete an initial forum post by Friday 09/18/20 at 11:55 PM and at least two replies to your fellow students by Sunday 09/20/20 at 11:55 PM.

**Purpose**: The purpose of this forum discussion questions is to have students self-reflect regarding the core values of the social workers and their own lives.

**Task**: During class this week, I will share the six core values of social workers described in the preamble of the NASW Code of Ethics and related to my values. These include:

- **Service**: Social workers' primary goal is to help people in need and to address social problems.
- **Social Justice**: Social workers challenge social injustice.
- **Dignity and Worth of the Person**: Social workers respect the inherent dignity and worth of the person.
- **Importance of Human Relationships**: Social workers recognize the central importance of human relationships.
- **Integrity**: Social workers behave in a trustworthy manner.
- **Competence**: Social workers practice within their areas of competence and develop and enhance their professional expertise.

Students are to discuss at least two of the values and discuss how they relate to their life and how they connect with it. They will then offer comments and engage in discussions with at least two of their fellow students.


**Criteria for Success**: Students will be able to write reflectively, giving readers insight into how they relate and connect with social work's core values. They will comment and discuss with at least to of their fellow students.
