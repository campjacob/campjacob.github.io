I hope that you are all doing well and getting ready for Spring Break next week. This week there is quite a bit due, but I think we also have a great class in store for you.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. This week the reading is:

- Garvin et al (2017) __Chapter 17, 19, and 22__

This week students complete there informal class presentations and we focus on groups related and topics related to substance abuse, intergroup conflict, and partner abuse.The agenda is as follows:

- Informal class presentations
- Activity attempting to change perceptions on discrimination
