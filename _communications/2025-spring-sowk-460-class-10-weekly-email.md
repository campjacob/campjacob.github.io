## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week 10, we will be doing a variety of activities. First, we will spend some time peer-reviewing your agency logic models. We will be working on writing skills and discussing how to write a methods section for your executive summary. Students will learn some tips and ideas for writing their methods section, and a couple of activities are drawn from the APA-style website to help improve students' academic writing. Students will read chapter 10 in Royse (2022) and consider how program fidelity and political challenges might arise in program evaluation. Students will also have an opportunity to work together in their groups

The agenda is as follows:

- Logic Model Peer Review
- Research article activity
- Discussion and tips regarding writing your methods section
- Time to work in your groups

## Unit Resources

During class, we will be doing a peer review of submitted logic models. You can find the [forum where they were submitted](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-06_224-32.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=d37955b3-db3b-49a9-bd75-3ddc23a3c148). As a group, you will review the logic model, and provide feedback in the same forum. You can also review the [syllabus handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=a2a11be2-095a-478a-a40c-bcdb9b3c5a89) that has the rubric and assignment description on it.

We will use a couple of worksheets from the APA Style Guide website during class. These include [Research Article Activity from the APA Style Website](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/apa-style-research-activity.pdf) and [Let's Get Active: Active Voice Writing Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/active-voice.pdf). Some of the content today comes from PLOS, a journal publisher, and their discussion of how to write a methods section. If you are interested, you can read PLOS (n.d.) [How to Write Your Methods](https://plos.org/resource/how-to-write-your-methods/).

I'll post the presentation slide before class.

I post all of the [lecture videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Lecture_Videos.jnz) in MyHeritage so you can view them.
