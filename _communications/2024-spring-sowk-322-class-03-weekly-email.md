## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week three, we are continuing to learn about the disability rights movement in the United States. Students have a reading quiz about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In the lecture video for this week, students will also have the opportunity to learn about legislation such as the ADA and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA) for schools. The following are the learning objectives for this week.

- Develop an understanding of the modern disability rights movement
- Demonstrate knowledge of some key components of the Americans with Disabilities Act
- Learn about some of the experiences of the initiators of the  disability rights movement in the United States
- Hear information about what some of the laws mean in practice for students in K-12 settings

## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Read chapter Rothman (2018) chapter three, _The Disability Rights Movement in the United States_
- Review the handout [An Overview of the Americans with Disabilities Act](https://adata.org/sites/adata.org/files/files/ADA_Overview_2015-handout.pdf) for the quiz
- Watch my lecture video, [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 - Week 03](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1c376e05-c08c-4f56-ba6d-b10401621d36)

**A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

Students must make at least three replies across any of the four open forums this week. If you are having some back-and-forth discussion in one of the forums, those replies can even be connected to just one of the forums. Remember, the expectation is to read all the posts across all the forums. A reply can include responding to the forum's prompts or another student's post. The expectation is that you contribute something substantial to the discussion. Be sure to post on two separate days to show engagement. The following are the four forums this week:

- [Disability History and Law: Where Are We Now and Where Do We Need To Go](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-03_129_-_24.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=a4e5f7ef-4d9b-40ae-a99e-ce14e7ef1380) is available for students to reflect on the various resources shared during week three's unit.
- Students can reflect on [What Does Access Really Mean](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-03_129_-_24.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=834b1904-1e47-47a6-a8b5-888811a1497c)?
- [The Disability Rights Movement](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-03_129_-_24.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=071d34e2-d1cf-49ef-acd3-f35eb8094125) looks to have students describe what has happened so far in the movement and identify some of the challenges faced by leaders in the movement.
- Students are encouraged to consider [Disability Law and Your Curiosity](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-03_129_-_24.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=caa3582e-8cf6-466c-8707-35ec2be8d572) and do further research about a topic and share what they have learned with the rest of the class.

**A-02: Disability Rights Quiz**

[A-02: Disability Rights Quiz](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=002b2654-213d-4a10-a71d-46ddd8615d15) is due Sunday 02/04/24 at 11:55 PM via My Heritage Assignments.

## Unit Resources

This week, you will be doing [A-02: Disability Rights Quiz](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=002b2654-213d-4a10-a71d-46ddd8615d15), which is all about the American with Disabilities Act (ADA, 1990). Mid-Atlantic ADA Center (n.d.) has a two-page, brief handout that includes all the information you need to pass the quiz. The handout is [An Overview of the Americans with Disabilities Act](https://adata.org/sites/adata.org/files/files/ADA_Overview_2015-handout.pdf). Netflix Film Club (2020) has a good film that talks about ADA law, [How the ADA Changed the Built World | Crip Camp | Netflix](https://youtu.be/5aiFVhXSvgc).

While the chapter does not discuss the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 2004), chapter four, Disability Legislation and the ADA in Rothman (2018), talks more about this. As we move into week four, we will be moving away from legislation and won't be reading this chapter. As many social worker positions that interact with persons with disabilities are related to schools, I wanted to ensure you are also exposed to that. You can find the lecture video recording for this class in the [lecture videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Lecture_Videos.jnz?portlet=Learning_Tools&screen=InlineToolDisplayView&screenType=change&PlacementID=d53a7c40-76f9-4193-9314-fa7aa427cc89) link in the sidebar. This week's video is at [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 - Week 03](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1c376e05-c08c-4f56-ba6d-b10401621d36). is focused on understanding how special education services work within a school setting. It examines the following:

- General overview of special education
- Referral process for special services
- Positions and rolls

<iframe src="https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=1c376e05-c08c-4f56-ba6d-b10401621d36&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=false&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay" aria-label="Panopto Embedded Video Player"></iframe>


All of the slides used for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are at [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 Week 03: Special Education Services in Schools](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/tpTZZi)

My presentation helps identify how schools implement ADA and IDEA and how professionals outside of school can coordinate with schools. For more information about IDEA, The American Institutes for Research (2015) provides an excellent short history and reasoning behind IDEA in their video, [Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: 40 Years Later](https://youtu.be/rgwstMsPvd4)

Finally, reading Rothman's (2018) chapter three, I was blown away by hearing about Ed Roberts and his advocacy and impact on persons with disabilities to pursue higher education. He was a significant force in the independent living movement. I wanted to hear more about him and came across Research & Training Center on Independent Living (2014) and their video [Ed Roberts: His Words, His Vision](https://youtu.be/ivaJsJ-mnm8) that I think is interesting to watch and learn more about how he saw the need to make changes to the world.
