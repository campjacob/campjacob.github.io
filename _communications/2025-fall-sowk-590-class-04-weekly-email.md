Knowing I just sent week three, here is looking forward to week four.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week four is synchronous with having class on Saturday (09/20/25) for SOWK 590. Students continue to work at the practicum and will submit their weekly journal. We will have the following agenda:

- FLED: Restorative Justice Practices
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students consider restorative justice and how it relates to their practice.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students will recognize the shared experiences of their peers in the practicum and be able to utilize the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.

## Unit Resources

With 12 students and seven weekly activities, I have taken over this week's student-led discussion. Knowing many of you work in school-based settings, I'm structuring my activity around school-based considerations for restorative justice. Clifford (2013) offers a manual that is available online for free, providing valuable information. See the link in the reference below. During the mindfulness activity, we will engage in a mindfulness exercise adapted from Linehan's (2015) _DBT Skills Training Manual_. We have a couple of extra copies of this as a spiral-bound book. I want to keep a personal copy, but I am willing to give away the others if there are a few people interested.

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Fall 2025 SOWK 590 Week 04 - Advanced Seminar I](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/pQTJ1X).
