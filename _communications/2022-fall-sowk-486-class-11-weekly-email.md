## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 is a continuation of the work we started in _Week 10 Social Work Planning_. This week takes some specific aspects of planning and getting started with the change process and has students dive into more depth with interactive activities. The plan is as follows:

- The process of cognitive restructuring
- Thinking distortions
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Application 
- Goals & Objectives
- Keeping everything organized

## Unit Assignments

Attend class

## Unit Resources

We will be talking some about documentation. Reamer provides a useful description of what social workers should be thinking about in regards to documentation. He reports about six primary functions of documentation. These include:

> (1) assessment and planning; (2) service delivery; (3) continuity and coordination of services; (4) supervision; (5) service evaluation; and (6) accountability to clients, insurers, agencies, other providers, courts, and utilization review bodies. (Reamer, 2005, p. 326)

I would recommend student take some time and review the article and consider how it will impact their documentation (see article [Reamer (2005) Documentation in social work.pdf](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=40b8520c-2762-49db-a434-64873832d3ef)).

We also watch a short talk by Burns (2014) during class that is a pretty powerful story. If you are interested in finding it later you can see it at [Feeling good - David Burns - TEDxReno](https://youtu.be/H1T5uMeYv9Q)
