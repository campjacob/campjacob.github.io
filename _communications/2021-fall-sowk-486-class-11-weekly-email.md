## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 is a continuation of the work we started in _Week 10 Planning in Generalist Practice_. This week takes some specific aspects of planning and getting started with the change process and has students dive into more depth with interactive activities. The plan is as follows:

- The process of cognitive restructuring
- Thinking distortions
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Application 
- Goals & Objectives
- Keeping everything organized

## Unit Resources

We will be talking some about documentation. Reamer provides a useful description of what social workers should be thinking about in regards to documentation. He reports about six primary functions of documentations. These include:

> (1) assessment and planning; (2) service delivery; (3) continuity and coordination of services; (4) supervision; (5) service evaluation; and (6) accountability to clients, insurers, agencies, other providers, courts, and utilization review bodies. (p. 326)

I would recommend student take some time and review the article and consider how it will impact their documentation.
