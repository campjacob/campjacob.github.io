I hope that you are all doing well. It sounds like we will be online until at-least the middle of the next month. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week three is about working with groups and their theoretical and philosophical foundations. We review content from Tosland (2017) _Chapter 1 - Group Dynamics_, Tropman (2017) _Chapter 2 - An Ecological/Systems/Seven C's Perspective on Groups_ and Smith et al. (2017) _Chapter 3 - Social Group Work in a Global Context_. We discuss an overview of working with groups, group dynamics, and group roles during this review. We also participate in an online group experience.

The plan for this week is as follows:

- Overview of working with groups
- Group dynamics and roles
- Tools and strategies in groups
