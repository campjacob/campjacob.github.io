Hey, I'm looking forward to seeing all of you in a couple of hours. It should be a pretty interactive and learning filled class.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 12 moves into a two-part series of looking at groups that we complete focused on different populations. The first week has readings from Ruffolo and Maker (2017) dive into group work focused on mental health. As we know, many of the groups that social workers end up facilitating include involuntary participants. Rooney and Chovanec (2017) offer many suggestions on how to succeed with this population. Finally, Malekoff (2017) talks about strength-based practices with youth, and Rittner (2017) looks specifically at child welfare. We will be talking about bits and pieces of doing group work with each of these populations during class. We will also be doing a participatory activity out of Aggression Replacement Training.
