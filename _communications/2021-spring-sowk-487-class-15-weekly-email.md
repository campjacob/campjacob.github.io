## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 15 continues on looking at task groups within a social work context. Bronstein and Abramson (2017) look into interdisciplinary team work. We will also supplement this discussion with Nancarrow et al. (2013) and discussion about the principles of good interdisciplinary team work. We also review what are some of the the best practices work working groups, as described by Ephross et al. (2017).

The agenda for this week is as follows:
