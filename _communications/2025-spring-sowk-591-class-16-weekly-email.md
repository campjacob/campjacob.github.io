As you are going through and finalizing things for your other classes, make sure you have finished everything for your practicum placements.

## Unit Assignments

Please complete your course evaluation for all of your classes. For our SOWk 591 and 596, you can complete your evaluation for the seminar based on the course. For 596, you can think about the process of doing the learning contract and site visits with me. You can access the survey on the left sidebar, where it says surveys. I only have two done so far for this semester.

Also, we need feedback about your placements. Please complete the [2025 Practicum Student Evaluation](https://forms.office.com/r/qX2yXdQZhV).

While the majority of you are finished with your practicum, if you are still engaging in practicum, please also make sure to submit journals and upload your hours.

You can submit your [April Hours](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_596/2425_SP-SOWK_596-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=1435b462-66b1-4861-8cba-617160b5a2b9) and your [May Hours](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_596/2425_SP-SOWK_596-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=a72e0ddb-07ab-4690-b6cf-afa6c0fbc91e).
