I'm looking forward to seeing everybody today. Sorry to be a  bit late in getting my class content out to you all. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

You have made it to the end of this class, as week 15 is our final session. Evaluation and the ending of the helping relationship is a an essential aspect of social work and direct practice with clients. Students will read Hepworth et al. (2023) which reviews methods for evaluating case progress, describes various factors that affect the termination process, identifies relevant tasks for both social workers and clients, and discusses skills essential to effectively managing termination. I've shared a podcast episode about engaging in Feedback Informed Treatment, which uses evaluation throughout the helping process. During class will also be reflecting on professional resilience. The agenda for the class session includes:

- Evaluation
- The evaluation process
- Termination
- Professional resilience

Learning objectives this week include

- Explain the importance of evaluation in social work and identify the key barriers and facilitators of effective evaluation practices.
- Discuss the process and tasks involved in the termination phase of the helping process and strategies for sustaining client progress.
- Reflect on their personal and professional growth through self-evaluation activities.
- Identify strategies for building professional resilience and integrating self-care into ongoing social work practice.

**Assignment 5: Extra Credit Assignment Options**

I offer students two different opportunities for extra credit. The first is a shorter assignment that evaluates one's own communication style and use of empathetic conversation through a reflective paper. The second is a more intensive research paper that investigates evidence-based assessment practices or generalist practice interventions for social workers. These assignments are extra credit and not mandatory.

**A-05a: [Extra Credit] Empathetic Communication Self-Evaluation Reflective Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 20 pts (5% of total grade in extra credit); _Deadline_ Monday 12/08/25 by 08:00 AM; _Completion_ via My Heritage Assignments as a file upload; _Locations_ [MyHeritage Assignment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_486W/2526_FA-SOWK_486W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=6a45159c-68a7-4091-b5e5-a264e644ddbe), [Syllabus Assignment Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Portlet.Resources/ViewHandler.ashx?id=10a94d25-063a-4916-8e4e-6bc7722ad8be);

**Purpose**: The _Empathetic Communication Self-Evaluation Reflective Paper_ provides an avenue for students to self-reflect regarding their communication style and the amount of empathetic communication they participate in. 

**Task**: Students will write a reflective paper of 500 to 750 words. They will consider their use of empathic language in daily life and how to be more empathic.

- Report on what your communication patterns are.

- Plan for what you can to improve your empathetic communication.

**Success**: Students will submit a paper demonstrating strong academic writing and self-reflective skills. Essays are graded according to the _Reflective Paper Rubric_. Feedback will be provided, and final grades are due by the instructor no later than 12/17/25 at 5:00 PM.

## Unit Resources

Hepworth et al. (2022) discuss outcome and session rating scales. There is some good discussion on the Social Work Podcast about how this can be implemented by Singer (2021). It is a good episode. You can find it at [the website](https://socialworkpodcast.blogspot.com/2021/12/FIT.html), on [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+Hdsrb4QA), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/131-feedback-informed-treatment-interview-with-scott-d/id216662405?i=1000545326119), or [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zb2NpYWx3b3JrcG9kY2FzdC5jb20vc29jaWFsd29ya3BvZGNhc3QueG1s/episode/aHR0cHM6Ly9zb2NpYWx3b3JrcG9kY2FzdC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi9GSVQuaHRtbA?sa=X&ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwiw1ObzruOCAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ).

We are talking about evaluation in class this week. It is also time for the evaluation of the class. I do value feedback. The results of the survey tool are confidential, so I don't receive any names related to specific responses. You should have a spot to take the evaluation on the sidebar.

For finals week, we are not having a test but are having a celebration. It will take place next Wednesday (12/10/25) at 5:30 in SWL 206 for an end-of-semester celebration. I created a Google Doc for planning - [Fall 2025 SOWK 486w Celebration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mS_qhI04gSIOXKR16p7dcBfXEKTaiF9YpzgHuXPiRKY/edit?usp=sharing).

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Fall 2025 SOWK 486w Week 15 - Evaluation and Termination](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/tlcY8B). For now, my website is broken and the presentation is uploaded as PDF as a resource below.
