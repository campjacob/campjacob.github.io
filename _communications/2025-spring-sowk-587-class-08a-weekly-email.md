I at least have the forums all developed. I will send out another email when I have posted the video and if there are other resources to share. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Description forthcoming.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Jarolmen and Batista-Thomas (2023) _Chapter 8: Current Societal Issues Affecting Children in Schools_
- Watch the forthcoming lecture video

[W-08 Small Group Discussion Forums](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/ðŸ’»_W-08_310-316.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=1575c65e-b538-4db0-b300-c1d410167127)

To address common issues affecting students in schools, social workers must be knowledgeable about the presenting problems and the resources that can be used to help address the challenges of those issues. You can find what group you are in the [A-02 Group Assignments and Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=9ac60a9e-af93-4ffa-a1b8-df0b7f662696) handout. Students must submit at least **five replies** this week in their group's forum. Competency G, as identified in the _Professional Transitions to Public Schools Coursework Requirement_ (2021, see WAC 181-79A-224), is focused on students demonstrating an understanding of various resources (including human, community, and technological). This week's content, along with the factsheet and intervention plans due later in the semester, is focused on supporting this. The discussion prompts include students exploring and defining a school-related problem. Students can share and hear about community resources, helping provide context for how those resources can be used and how they can be integrated into a school-based setting. Students will also consider technological and human resources and examples of their use. Culturally responsive practices and how they connect with resources are also to be discussed, along with the place that policy has in considering school-related problems.

This week, the **fifth person** on each group list is the leader (unless your group determines to have somebody else do it). It is the responsibility of the group as a whole that one of the members engages in this leadership role. This team leader will develop a reply in [W-08 Discussion Forum Synthesis](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_587/2425_SP-SOWK_587-0/ðŸ’»_W-08_310-316.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=e2db4029-4fd8-4d2b-b25c-58f74b1a73e8) that will provide an overview of your group's discussion. Even though only the team leader needs to post in this forum, I'd like for everybody to read it so you can hear what other groups discussed.

## Unit Resources

I will post a lecture video here. My current plan is to talk about the factsheet assignment and share an example of an information notebook.
