I hope you are all well and getting some rest in before Summer semester starts. I have gone through and completed the grading for all of my classes but this one (sorry that you are all last). I was hoping to finish today, but I have ran out of time. I've made it through a good number of your final papers and people are doing well on them. I'm traveling to Seattle for a networking event but we will see if I can finish the rest first thing in the morning. I also have a couple of late assignments people have submitted that I need to grade and then I will be done (probably not, as I need to start preparing for the Summer class). I have been wanting to send an email, less to update about grading, but to remind people to do you evaluations. Please complete these (not just this class but for all of them). For Social Work in Schools I only have **8** of the 24 expected evaluations. If you haven't signed up for you summer classes, please do that as well (SOWK 588 and 589).
