I hope that you are all having a great week. A reminder. No in-person class tonight. Attached is the work for this week.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 is asynchronous. The topic is cost analysis for program evaluation. While none of your program evaluations include this, it is a helpful framework for students to learn about and understand. Royse (2023) describes cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies. In the forums, students can engage with the reading content, consider how they would design a study, and explore further literature.

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Royse (2023) _Chapter 9 Cost Analysis_

**A-01: Class Engagement and Attendance**

This week, there are three forums for students to write replies. I want you to submit at least three replies. Two should be your reply to one of the prompts in the forums, and the third can be a meaningful response to one of your peers' replies. The following are the forums for week three:

- [Week 11 Reading Discussion](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-11_331-46.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=b8e254cc-ac7f-44f8-8e0c-3f7801cfd8cd) gives students a space to consider and share about the content they are engaging in this week.
- Considering how you would [Design a Cost-Effectiveness Study](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-11_331-46.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=bd3b1ec4-3af1-4d6d-898a-c33e85c0f386) is a valuable method for learning about engaging in cost analysis in program evaluation.
- One of my general goals for students is to expose them to more literature. The forum [Exploring Literature Around Cost Analysis](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/W-11_331-46.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=054bffe0-7a13-4a28-b870-c71b87cfa322) provides an avenue to share findings you might have.
