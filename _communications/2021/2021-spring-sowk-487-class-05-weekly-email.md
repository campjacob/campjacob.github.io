Sorry to be a bit behind in getting this out for you all.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week five, we continue to focus on working with families. Students are expected to read Prest and Protinsky (1993). We will continue to talk about the dimensions of family assessments. The class session should be fairly practical with several activities. The agenda is as follows:


- Finish reviewing dimensions of family systems framework assessment
- Specific tools for working with families
- Dysfunctional family roles

## Unit Resources

You **need to read** Prest and Protinsky (1993).

<div style="margin: 0 0 0 2em; text-indent: -2em;" markdown="1">

Prest, L. A., & Protinsky, H. (1993). [Family systems theory: A unifying framework for co-dependence](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=a2e7ed29-9539-4e53-8e15-656045f9f2bb). _The American Journal of Family Therapy, 21_(4), 352-360. https://doi.org/10.1080/01926189308251005

During the class session we will be going through a number of handouts. You don't have to print them, but some students might find it beneficial. This is especially true for [Holistic Wellness Wheel](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=3574d2f1-2709-4fd6-b994-658cd1f7294e), as you will be asked to fill this in during class. If you are unable to print this, it would be fairly simple to draw on your own piece of scratch paper.

Along with the wellness wheel, the following are other handouts for this class session:

- [Invalidating vs Invaliding Statements](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=b88c6dc2-126b-4d25-8bc8-fbecca355c37)
- [Fifteen Fair Fighting Rules](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=120651c6-2275-4cd6-954a-2e01a6f3add8)
- [Time-Outs](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=2d04784e-fd44-492c-a419-9e8119d0817a)


The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
