## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 moves into a three-part series of looking at groups that we complete focused on different populations. The first week has readings from Ruffolo and Maker (2017) dive into group work focused on mental health. As we know, many of the groups that social workers end up facilitating include involuntary participants. Rooney and Chovanec (2017) offer many suggestions on how to be successful with this population. Finally, Malekoff (2017) talks about strength-based practices with youth, and Rittner (2017) looks specifically at child welfare. We will be talking about bits and pieces of doing group work with each of these populations during class. We will also be doing a participatory activity out of Aggression Replacement Training.

### A-02: Asynchronous Class Engagement

**Meta**: _Points_ 5 points (1.25% of final grade); _Deadline_ initial posts due Friday 03/26/21 at 11:55 PM and two replies due Sunday 03/28/21 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ Via My Heritage Course Forums at [W-11 Groups with Involuntary Clients](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2021_SP-SOWK_487W-0/W-11_322-328.jnz?portlet=Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=a1c316d3-0a1d-4ae0-90cd-0015474d1abf).

**Purpose**: To provide students an opportunity to consider potential types of groups with involuntary clients.

**Task**: Rooney and Chovanec (2017) describe five theoretical bases for involuntary clients' interventions. These include reactance theory, solution-focused brief treatment (SFBT), Partners for Change Outcome Management Systems (PCOMS), the stages-of-change model, motivational interviewing. Students are to consider the population of involuntary clients and the theories discussed in the text in completing a discussion forum. Students what potential group themes or topics might include, or the goals that social workers might have for involuntary clients.

**Criterion for Success**: Students will write a paragraph talking about involuntary clients and potential group themes they might work on and why. They will use strong academic writing skills and both in-text and reference list entries as necessary.
