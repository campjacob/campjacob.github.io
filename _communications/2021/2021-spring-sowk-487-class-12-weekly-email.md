I hope that you are all doing well. Last week, for your [W-11 Groups with Involuntary Clients](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2021_SP-SOWK_487W-0/W-11_322-328.jnz?portlet=Forums&screen=TopicView&id=a1c316d3-0a1d-4ae0-90cd-0015474d1abf) forum, I did not create "an assignment" for it and I know some people had some trouble fining it. I have decided to make it extra-credit for those who completed it. Class tomorrow will be very activity based and should be a lot of fun.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 12 continues to examining group work related to various settings. Córdova et al. (2017) discusses substance abuse and preventing adolescent substance abuse. Connected with this theme, students are to watch a TED talk, [Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong | Johann Hari](https://youtu.be/PY9DcIMGxMs), and discuss it on Flipgrid. Bargal (2017) talks about reducing intergroup conflicts. We will be doing an activity called that I first did while working on BASW at Eastern Washington University as a part of my participation in the Residential Hall Association as a novel group for addressing prejudice. Finally, Sounders (2017) discusses interventions for partner abuse. We will be talking assertiveness training and how that can look.

The agenda for this week is as follows:

- Activity attempting to change perceptions on discrimination
- Group interventions for partner abuse

### Assignment 05 [Extra Credit]: Group Work and Cultural Competency Opportunities

The faculty for this course offers students two different opportunities for extra credit during this course. The first is a smaller assignment for attending a therapeutic or task group and drafting a reflective paper regarding the experience. The second is a more intensive research paper looking into culturally competent practices in social work. Grades for the assignment will be included in the submission of final course grades, which are required to be posted no later than 05/12/21 at 5:00 PM. While extra credit can be given for completion of this assignment, the total points in the class are unable to exceed 400 points, and thus any extra credit points gained which go over the total class grade would be not be included in the final grade. Late submission is not accepted for this assignment.

**Purpose**: Offer students an assignment to earn extra credit points where they are able to reflect on participation in a group and reflect on the experience through the lens of social work.

**Task**: The student would participate in a therapeutic or task group and write about their experience. The group would be attending an AA or something similar offered in the community. Due to the COVID–19 Pandemic, online group options are acceptable. As well, the group can be a task group especially a policy-related group (such as a school board meeting). After attending and observing the group, the student will write a short reflective paper.

**Criterion for Success**: The reflective paper will be approximately 500 to 750 words in length. The paper will be graded according to the reflective paper rubric included in the syllabus.

#### Assignment 05b - Evidence-Based Practices for Culturally Competent Social Work Research Paper

**Meta**: Points 40 extra credit points (10% of final grade); Deadline Sunday at 04/04/21 at 11:55 PM; Completion submission via assignments on My Heritage

Students may choose from any given cultural practice to base their research on (some examples could range from how social workers use eye contact in working with clients to best practices for working with a Muslim client). The paper will generally describe the following:

- Description of the evidence-based practice being reviewed
