## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 10 serves a dual purpose. The readings are around online group formats, and you will be using that as your discussion forums for the week. During class, we will just be doing the presentations for the Family Treatment Modality Research Projects.

## Unit Resources

You **need to read** Garvin et al. (2017) Chapter 33

I went through and compiled all of the resources you all identified as Mutual Aid style groups. It includes contact information and all of that. It might be helpful as you start working with clients: [List of Mutual Aid Groups](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/icsfs/week-06-handout-local-mutual-aid-list.pdf?target=95fc2d3c-4d49-406c-b8f3-4e43d2e6c23d) (or as a [Word Document](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=c1e81cc1-f507-4c91-95f6-e084927c8d9a)).


## Unit Assignments

### A-01: Synchronous Class Engagement

Attend Class

### A-02: Asynchronous Class Engagement

**Meta**: _Points_ 5; _Deadline_ initial posts due Friday 03/19/21 at 11:55 PM and two replies for post one due Sunday 03/21/21 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ Via My Heritage Course Forums.

**Purpose**: Students will have an opportunity to discuss technology-mediated groups and their strategies. They will be able to consider how it can relate to themselves as practitioners and also consider some potential tools to support them in this.

**Task**: Students will complete two discussion forums. Their descriptions are as follows:

[W-10 Discussion Forum 01: Current Apps or Online Tools](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2021_SP-SOWK_487W-0/W-10_315-321.jnz?portlet=Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=82b16b08-d574-4b75-9ae4-fb708a29edf6) includes the following prompt:

Finch (2017) describes practice strategies for technology-mediated groups based on psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral treatment, and self-help group. Over the last couple of years, there have been many websites, mobile phone applications, and other online types of resources to assist persons with mental health or other types of issues (around substance abuse behavior change, etc.) in a self-help format. For this forum, students are to find one of these applications or other online format self-help communities and provide a description of it, why it might be helpful for clients, and a citation that would allow the reader to find the resource. Consider joining the community to see what it looks like and how it works to explain the resource better. Your post should be written using an academic style and include both an in-text citation and a reference list entry. To the best of their ability, students should attempt not to duplicate other students' resources to increase the diversity of resources. Students will use their replies to vote for the website or application they find either the most interesting or the most useful. You will pick two posts to reply to and be able to vote for your classmate’s post by making a reply.

[W-10 Discussion Forum 02: Personal Reflection on Technology](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2021_SP-SOWK_487W-0/W-10_315-321.jnz?portlet=Forums&screen=TopicView&screenType=change&id=82b16b08-d574-4b75-9ae4-fb708a29edf6) includes the following prompt:

Finch (2017) and class discussions in SOWK 486 and 487 have introduced how technology can be used in social work practice. Students are encouraged to reflect on how they might see using technology in their practice post-graduation. Students may make replies to their fellow students, but it is not required for this forum.

The family treatment modalities research project is worth 50% of the student's final grade. Students will be placed into groups of three or four peers to complete a research project regarding an evidence-based treatment modality for family and or marital therapy. Students may select any intervention, the following are examples of empirically supported family therapeutic interventions: Jim Alexander’s Functional Family Therapy, Howard Liddle’s Multidimensional Family Therapy, Scott Henggler’s Multisystemic Therapy, Jose Szapocznik’s Brief Strategic Family Therapy, and Attachment-Based Family Therapy. This project contains two separate assignments. Firstly, a research article will be written jointly by the group and will be worth 100 points. Secondly, an in-class group presentation will be completed worth another 100 points.

**Meta**: Points 100 points (25% of final grade); Deadline 03/17/21 during class; Completion Students will complete their group presentations during class.

**Purpose**: The Family Treatment Modality Research Presentation opens up a suitable occasion for students to practice making a scholarly presentation and discussion regarding scholarly topics.
