I think the first week of presentations went well. This weekend, I have graded the presentations from week seven. They were all really good. I also have gotten caught up a bit on grading the other forums. I still have some more to do. This week will be very much the same as last week. 


## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

We are in Week 8, and we are at the end of our two weeks of presentations! There will be no quizzes or videos. Instead, all weekly points will come from discussion participation. The objectives are as follows:

- Students will learn from each other by providing group presentations on selected topics.
- Students will demonstrate the ability to gather information about conditions.


## Unit Resources

While it is the same information that is in the syllabus, there is a handout - [Assignment 03: Disability Population Group Presentation Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=47955b24-239b-4362-97f2-384531d88f15).
