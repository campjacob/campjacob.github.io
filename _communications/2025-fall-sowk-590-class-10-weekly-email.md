Our mindfulness activity should be a lot of fun this week. I'm going to follow up with the other class and see if we want to start together.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week ten is synchronous with having class on Saturday (11/01/25) for SOWK 590. Students continue to work at the practicum and will submit their weekly journal. We will have the following agenda:

- Midcourse Feedback
- SLED: Community Organizing & Activism
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will consider how community organizing and activism can relate to their practice.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students will recognize their peers' shared experiences in the practicum and use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.

## Unit Resources

Our mindfulness activity we are going to do this week will be to create and use poi for spinning. I participated in an activity related to this at the NASW conference I went to last month and wanted to share it with all of you. You can find some information about the [Flow Arts Institute](https://flowartsinstitute.com/) and  some resources by the presenter [Resources - Sound Connections Counseling and Consulting](https://www.lorisirs.com/resources). You can also see [Poi (performance art) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(performance_art)).
