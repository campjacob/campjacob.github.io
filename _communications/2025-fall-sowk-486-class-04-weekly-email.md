It's almost the weekend. I've posted the content for next week for you all and I'll see you on Wednesday and have a wonderful weekend!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week four is a continuation of laying the groundwork for this course. It provides an overview of the helping process. Hepworth et al. (2023) categorize the helping process into three phases.

- Phase 1: Exploration, Engagement, Assessment, and Planning
- Phase II: Implementation and Goal Attainment
- Phase III: Evaluation and Termination

During the session, we will examine an overview of the considerations we should have in each phase. We will also examine how we establish the environment with our clients and what the interview process entails. Finally, we will spend some time discussing some potential ethical dilemmas. The agenda is:

- Overview of the three phases of the helping process
- Setting the environment
- Interviewing clients
- Practice with ethical dilemmas

The Learning Objectives this week include:

- Describe the three phases of the helping process and identify key tasks associated with each phase.
- Demonstrate strategies for creating a supportive environment during client interviews, including setting, preparedness, and rapport-building.
- Practice and evaluate techniques for starting the interview, engaging clients, and initiating assessment.
- Identify behaviors and communication styles that enhance or inhibit client trust and motivation.
- Analyze ethical dilemmas using professional values and guidelines to inform decision-making in complex situations.
