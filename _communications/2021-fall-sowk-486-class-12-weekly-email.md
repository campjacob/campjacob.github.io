## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week 12, we look to develop strategies for how to impact change with our clients. This is generally the goal with most services we provide as social workers. To understand how we affect change, we will look at the following:

- Additive Empathy & Interpretation
- Confrontation
- Barriers to change

## Unit Resources

There are different lenses that people see the understand the process of change for. Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides many helpful and useful resources. Hepworth et al. (2017) discuss SAMHSA working definition of recovery. Go to the [brochure](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/SAMHSA-s-Working-Definition-of-Recovery/PEP12-RECDEF) and read through it. Consider which aspect of the 10 principles for recovery you find to be the most important and how you see implementing that into your practice.

The two required readings also revolve significantly around the concept of motivational interviewing. If you get the chance in graduate school to take a course in motivational interviewing, I'd highly recommend it. As a practitioner, I find the strategies immensely useful. Miller and Rollnick (2013) is the basis of the therapeutic intervention. In 2002, Moyers and Rollnick published a paper attempting to put into perspective client resistance and is a foundational aspect of motivational interviewing. It is also much more approachable, and I've provided a link in the reference list entry to read it if you would like. Interconnected with motivational interviewing, is understanding if your client is ready for change. We have talked some about this in class, but Littell and Girvin (2004) offer a useful analysis of how we can consider the stages of change and the complex interactions that often are related to child welfare.
