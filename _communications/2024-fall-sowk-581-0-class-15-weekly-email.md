## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 15 is the last week of regular course content and takes place during Thanksgiving. The content this week is focused on special issues in clinical practice. We are wrapping up this course and preparing to move on to the Spring Semester. We will also be planning for students' submission of their cumulative assignment for this class, the case study paper.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 13 - Special Issues in Clinical Practice

**Weekly Online Discussion Forums**

This week, five discussion forums are available for you to engage in. I want you to make a total of **six replies** across any of the forums. At least four replies must be related to any of the prompts provided. The other replies can be answering prompts or replying to your peers. The following is a brief overview of the forums for this week:

- The forum [Chapter 13 Reflection Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-15_1125_-_121.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=997f7825-aa87-4ffe-aa4d-f8c2ca3d8bb4) explores special issues in clinical practice, prompting students to consider ethical dilemmas, such as addressing encounters with clients, conducting risk assessments, and the use of telehealth as a treatment modality.

- The forum [Key Insights and Lessons from this Course](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-15_1125_-_121.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=AddPost&screenType=change&tId=a7fb4caa-f32b-4509-ab3a-9f10dd349179) encourages students to reflect on and share significant learning experiences from the class, whether related to course content or personal growth.

While you don't have to post in all the forums, I expect you to read all the posts across all the forums. Knowing this is the last week of content for this class, and there is Thanksgiving this week, I am extending the deadline to be due next Thursday (e.g., 12/5) at 8 AM. 

**Reading Quizzes**

You have a reading quiz, [W-15 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 13](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=fc6ef7f6-0022-4bcb-8784-ddc9e8edca9b). I am making this due at the same time as the forums, Thursday (12/5) at 8 AM.

**A-01: Case Study Paper**

**Meta**:  Points 100 pts (20% of final grade); Deadline Monday 12/09/24 at 08:00 AM; Completion via file upload on MyHeritage in the assignments section. In the course syllabus tab, you can find a PDF of the this assignment.

**Purpose**: The purpose of this assignment is to document direct service implementation at the micro, mezzo, macro levels with a real-life client. The assignment is designed to follow the students as they provide an intervention to a real-world client at their practicum placement. Students will be able to demonstrate their ability to engage in assessment, engagement, service planning, and intervention delivery to address client needs at micro, mezzo, and macro levels. They will be able to show their ability to engage in strong academic writing and link client problems and real-world situations to literature and evidence-based practices.

**Task**: The case study paper is a key assignment for SOWK 581. The assignment is designed to encompass many aspects of social work practice with individuals, groups, and systems. It seeks to address two competencies from the CSWE (2022) and the specialized practice behaviors defined for the MSW Program. First is an opportunity to demonstrate ethical and professional behavior, which is competency one. This includes examining policy and research and assessing culturally responsive decision-making models. The second EPAS evaluated is competency seven, which is focused on assessment and looks specifically at using advanced methods and adapting assessment based on cultural contexts. 

The student's final product will be an individually submitted report detailing a case study they have engaged in during the semester. The case study spans the process of a student assessing, developing a service delivery plan, and implementing an intervention with an individual client. Students are to use their practicum placement to provide a real-world case study for this assignment that details the work they are doing in their practicum. Because this paper is based on an actual client, names and identifying details must be changed to provide client confidentiality. An informed consent will be signed. Students should be using some of their meetings with their field placement supervisors to talk about the developments in working with this client. Discussion of this supervision and consultation should be included throughout your paper as applicable. Discussion regarding ethical decision-making, making direct connections to the NASW code of ethics or other related reasoning should be identified throughout the paper. The ADEI policy connection section should examine current or historical policies that could impact their client and be considered oppressive and apply an ethical decision-making model to working with their client.

Final papers, excluding the appendix, should be between 10 and 15 pages. They will follow the APA style guide (American Psychological Association, 2020), and include a title page, introduction, ADEI policy connection, client assessment, service plan, intervention description, recommendations, reference, and appendix.

- **Title Page**: Should be formatted as an APA student paper.
- **Introduction**: The introduction should provide context to the services you have been providing your client. This should include a description of the organization, an overview of the services offered, and general needs addressed in the setting. Discussion of your ethical use of technology related to client records and documentation and your relationship to agency policy should be explained. 
- **ADEI Policy Connection**: Policy should inform your practice, and the ADEI policy connection section of your final paper will discuss policy and research related to the impact of racism, oppression, violence, and historical trauma. Describe your decision-making model and how you engage in culturally responsive practices related to Latinx, indigenous, or agricultural communities.
- **Client Assessment**: The assessment as a document will be included as an appendix. The assessments should gather the information necessary to understand your client's needs so that a service plan can be developed. This section will include a description of any evaluations conducted, along with a description of the identified problem areas and needs. Some of the identified needs should be related to peer-reviewed literature. The rationale for assessments should be articulated. Students should clarify how their assessment is culturally responsive, and how you adapted the assessment should be included. Connections pertaining to the client's environment (e.g., family, groups, organization) should be included.
- **Service Planning**: The completed service plan form will be included in an appendix. This section should include a general description of the service plan developed collaboratively with your client. Client voice and mutual engagement in the planning process should be described. The rationale for the developed plan and its linkage with peer-reviewed literature should be included in this section. Services plans should consist of at least a description of the problem being addressed, the identified goal, relevant strengths and resources, potential barriers, and tasks. Students should have identified goals at each level of intervention (e.g., micro, mezzo, and macro). 
- **Intervention Description**: Describe the implementation of your interventions and include a detailed discussion of the student's engagement with the client. Students should chronicle their use of interpersonal skills to engage the client. The discussion should also include their approach to providing culturally responsive practices and how they were implemented.
- **Recommendations**: A description of continued needs to be addressed, and recommendations for continuing or discontinuing services with this client should be provided. 
- **Reference**: Any references used throughout your paper should be included in the reference section and formatted using APA style.
- **Appendix**: Students' papers should refer to each appendices. At the minimum, students must include a copy of their assessment, service delivery plan, and a progress note example. Students are encouraged to include other items as deemed beneficial to their overall case study.

**Success**: Students will be assessed using the Case Study Paper and Competency 1 and 7 Rubric. A quality paper will provide a comprehensive overview of your chosen case and an explanatory description of your therapeutic rationale. Students will use solid academic scholarship and follow the assignment description. Students will also demonstrate competency in ethical and professional behavior and assessment methods.
