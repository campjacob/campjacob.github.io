So some people seem to be having some trouble determining how to submit your introduction onto Moodle. Hopefully this helps clarify. You don't upload the document. You just submit the text (I felt that like this would be easier for the person who is going to be providing the peer review for you. I believe that everybody has been able to sign up for the account and to enroll in the class.

I created a short video using PanOpto about how to submit your assignment from your Moodle Account. It can be seen at [Week 02b: How to Submit a Post in Moodle](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=4e5fbb50-d6c7-413f-bb0c-aabb00546717). If you view this email by clicking the link above at the website, it also embedded there.

Have a great rest of your memorial day weekend.
