I hope you all had a great week and and I am looking forward to class.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week six, we are continuing to explore methodologies for program evaluations. Many of your program evaluations will gather staff perspectives on the agency, similar to quality assurance design methodologies. We will work on how to develop a survey and create an example version during class. We will also examine your logic models and how to develop them. Students will continue to work on their general evaluations and reflect on the experience in their journals.

The agenda for the class is as follows:

- Quality assurance design strategies
- Developing questions used on surveys
- Practice developing a quality assurance design study
- Logic models

## Unit Resources

During class, we will be doing an activity that will culminate in building a survey. I have a blank Microsoft form at [2025 Spring SOWK 460w BASW Quality Assurance Survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?subpage=design&FormId=mlmXan5KOES6ffFDvDcevHtyHB-2cQVOrTak2DaV6wJURExKT0Y0RkpDRVBKNkxTWk82MDRDNVhSSi4u&Token=574bdc388d054e0bb2325a1e6f8f934f). Please note you will have to be signed in to your Heritage Account to access it. 

When we are talking about survey questions, I share some information from the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (2011) and a [tip sheet](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/136522/cdc_136522_DS1.pdf). It is good information.

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Spring 2025 SOWK 460w Week 06 - Quality Assurance Designs and Understanding an Agency Through a Logic Model](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/liCMyT).
