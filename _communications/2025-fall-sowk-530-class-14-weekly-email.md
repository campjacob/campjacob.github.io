## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

The focus of week 14 is on introspection about our personal growth and development. We have spent the rest of the semester discussing how we can support, affect change, and understand our client's needs. This week, I want us to turn inward and consider how we do that for ourselves. The following are the objectives I have for you this week.

- Be introduced to the concept of the Wounded healer
- Consider gratitude as a type of self-care
- Consider what you can do to enhance your personal growth as you go through school

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Newcomb et al. (2015) and O'Connell et al. (2018)
- Watch [Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell. (2019)](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0)

**A-01: Class Participation and Engagement**

For week 14, we are just having class online, and I am giving you the opportunity to respond in a couple of forums. My hope and expectation is that you spend some time being introspective this week and write about it. There are three forums open for you to participate in; you don't have to write in all three, but you must post at least two replies across any of the three forums (feel free to post more if you are interested). The following are the three forums:

- First, there is a forum to be able to discuss your own [personal development and education](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/💻_W-14_1124-1130.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=31e6ebca-55b6-4e75-bfc1-1f726bff9d39) and what things you have done or want to do to improve yourself.
- Second, it is a forum to discuss the reading and concept of [considering the wounded healer and practice](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/💻_W-14_1124-1130.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=03487950-fcfc-4e2e-bb14-4226fe318ed9)
- Finally, there is a forum regarding [taking on the perspective of gratitude](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_530/2526_FA-SOWK_530-0/💻_W-14_1124-1130.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=071805ee-b080-4f94-b953-d486b41cfef9)

## Unit Resources

In thinking about being introspective, I want students to consider gratitude. I am including a powerful YouTube video by Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell titled [An Antidote to Dissatisfaction](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0) as an assignment this week.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPPPFqsECz0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I have provided two journal articles as handouts for you to read. First, O'Connell et al. (2018) share context for the use of gratitude in a counseling setting. The second is related to Jung's concept of the wounded healer and how it can provide insight and guidance into the impact of entering social work as a wounded healer (Newcomb et al., 2015).

Make sure you have a wonderful break.
