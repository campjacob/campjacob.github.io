I hope you feel some release as you have finished the first semester of your BASW program. Three more, and you will be graduating and moving on to other awesome things. You guys have done a great job this last semester. It has been a pleasure getting to teach you. We will meet in person for class on Wednesday, but it is not mandatory (e.g., you don't have to come if you don't want to).

## What to Expect

**Finals Week**: 12/08/21
**Content**: Semester Celebration
**Due**: Final Grades Due Wednesday 12/15/21 at 5:00 PM by Instructor

We will meet for class and have a little celebration to celebrate the end of the semester. Attendance is non-mandatory. There will **not** be a zoom portion of class. If people want to bring table top games, that is encouraged. 

## To Do List

- Attend class with a table top game if so desired
- Have a wonderful winter vacation and holidays
