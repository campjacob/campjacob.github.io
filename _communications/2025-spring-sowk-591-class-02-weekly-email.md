Hope your week is going well!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week two is asynchronous, with no in-person class. Students continue to work at the practicum and will submit their weekly journal.

## Unit Assignments

Submit your weekly journal for [W-02 A-02 Reflective Journal](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_591/2425_SP-SOWK_591-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=1e9b31f5-9145-458e-9532-7cefd6a62ea4) by Sunday.

As well, we are coming to the end of the month, and you must submit your signed form for [January Practicum Hours](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_596/2425_SP-SOWK_596-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=ebc16f88-f2a2-4c22-afb7-bc0781e27bc9), they are due no later than 2/15. Plan to review it with your supervisors during your next visit.

## Unit Resources

Remember, I'm here to support you if there is anything I can do for you. You can find [my schedule](https://vsp.ink/now).

In your journal entries, remember to include some self-reflection. How was your interaction with the student, and how did you feel afterward? What feelings or things arose while you were engaging in an experience? What is something that you learned about yourself? The idea is to consider your tasks and your thought process/personal learning and growth.

Also, Jess and I have been talking. One of the things we wanted to make sure we are consistent about is tracking that you are getting your supervision time. Most of you are already doing this, but when you have supervision, make sure you include that you did so in your journal so we can see that you are doing it. It is a great space to be able to reflect as well. What did you get out of it, what might you do differently, etc?

## To-Do Lists

- Submit your weekly journal
- Keep your head up
