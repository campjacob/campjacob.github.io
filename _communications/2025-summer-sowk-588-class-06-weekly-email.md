Let me know if you have thoughts about the the last class session. See the Google doc below.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week six is asynchronous, with no in-person class session. In Edin and Shaefer (2016), you will read about the challenges faced by communities and families in extreme poverty, and there is a forum to share additional examples. The reading from Linquiti (2022) shares two lenses that can be used to analyze policy, including equity and economics. There are forums to discuss the content of the textbook and consider how you can apply the content to your policy analysis. Students submit one of the key assignments for SOWK 588, the policy analysis paper, providing an opportunity for you to demonstrate skill at assessing policy.

The learning objectives this week include:

- Describe the lived experiences of individuals and families facing extreme poverty.    
- Apply the equity and economic lenses from Linquitiâ€™s policy framework to analyze social policies affecting marginalized populations.
- Critically examine policy issues using ethical and human rights standards, including the NASW Code of Ethics and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
- Demonstrate competency in policy analysis by completing and submitting the Policy Analysis Paper, integrating theory, values, research, and practice to assess real-world policies.

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Edin and Shafer (2016) Chapter 5: _A World Apart_
- Linquiti (2022) Chapter 8: _The Equity Lens_
- Linquiti (2022) Chapter 9: _The Economic Lens_

**A-01 Weekly Online Discussion Forum**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are five forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. There are less required then expected because I want to give you space to also focus on your policy papers and I have posted them later then I hoped.  These forums include the following:

- **[Glimpses of a World Apart](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/ðŸ’»_W-06_630-76.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=7f84d81d-8244-4414-afc2-22dad4e3d3c8)** invites you to share stories or media that depict people living in deep poverty, helping us consider lives vastly different from our own.

**A-02a Policy Analysis Paper**

**Meta**: Points 200 points (30% of final grade); _Deadline_ is due no later than 08:00 AM on Monday 07/07/25; _Completion_ file upload to Anthology through MyHeritage Assignments; _Locations_ [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/icsfs/a-02a-policy-analysis-paper.pdf?target=89cb1fb6-2018-4e72-bd1e-2321b68258ec) and [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=98c2600b-4799-45f7-a0e9-400e2f8c99a3)

**Purpose**: The _Policy Analysis Paper_ is designed to enable students to demonstrate the skills necessary to understand and analyze social issues through the lens of policy and advocacy. They will need to engage in value-driven, advanced social policy practice through integrating theory, diversity, practice, results, and outcomes. 

**Task**: Students will complete a policy analysis paper exploring a current social issue that impacts a marginalized and or oppressed population. The final paper should include at least the following sections:

- **Identification and Research of Social Issue and Policy**: Select a current social issue and a specific related policy (e.g., immigration law, welfare reform). Analyze how the issue and policy affect marginalized and oppressed populations. Research and describe how the policy operates across different system levels (e.g., local, state, tribal, federal). Use evidence and data to inform the identification of challenges and potential solutions.
- **Ethical and Human Rights Analysis**: Summarize the key issues and findings of your analysis. Review how the social construction of the target population influences the design and implementation of the policy. Compare the policy to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the NASW Code of Ethics, identifying areas of alignment or conflict and specific rights or principles that are upheld or violated.
- **Application of Social Policy Theory**: Use a social policy theory (e.g., political economy, social construction, cost-benefit, feminist theory, critical race theory, etc.) to examine the policy. Discuss how the policy affects individuals, families, groups, communities, and organizations. Support your analysis and the theory description with scholarly research.
- **Policy Alternatives and Advocacy Recommendations**: Present two or more policy alternatives. Evaluate how well each aligns with ethical standards and human rights principles. Clearly propose a policy adjustment and outline a realistic strategy for legislative advocacy and justice-based reform.

**Success**: A successful submission will demonstrate students' ability to analyze social policy and promote social justice with a clear focus on how marginalized and oppressed populations are impacted across local, state, tribal, and federal levels. The paper will reflect the integration of scholarship to understand the social challenges and potential solutions. Students will provide a basis for social policy theory, describe it, and engage in meaningful discussions relating it to social policy. Students' papers will be well-organized, demonstrating high-quality work and following the assignment expectations. 

**Policy Analysis Paper and Competency 2 Practice Behaviors Rubric**

The _Policy Analysis Paper and Competency 2 Practice Behaviors Rubric_ assesses students' ability to critically examine a current social issue and its related policy across multiple system levels, with a focus on how marginalized and oppressed populations are impacted. The rubric assesses students' advanced policy practice skills (e.g., ability to gather and synthesize relevant data, apply ethical reasoning, and analyze policy through theoretical frameworks). It also measures the depth of students' engagement with human rights standards and professional social work values. High-quality submissions will demonstrate scholarly rigor using APA formatting and follow the assignment expectations.

Competency 2: Advance Human Rights and Social, Racial, Economic, and Environmental Justice

a. Utilize policy analysis skills to inform policy formulation practices and policy implementation effects on oppressed and marginalized populations, including rural and tribal communities.  
b. Organize legislative policy advocacy with individuals, families, groups, communities, and organizations to advance human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice.

## Unit Resources

There is no lecture video this week. We are still finalizing the logistics of our last class, but I'm excited about what we will be able to offer. We have two organizations that are actively hiring and have confirmed their attendance, and we are waiting on a few more. It is still a work in progress. There is a planning Google Doc, [Summer 2025 MSW Evaluation and Career Day](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nSlJ58VDGrsCHLW0TcHJc8PZ7BndD5ZAKNMn0XAeYeU/edit?usp=sharing), where you can add your name, indicate what you are bringing to the potluck, and view the planned agenda.
