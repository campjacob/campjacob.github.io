I just want to encourage you all. I know it is a lot of reading. This weeks text is really good. I think it useful in helping shape us in how we think and reason and useful for making us better scholars. I encourage you to stick with it. Have a great week.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week four is asynchronous. In Edin and Shaefer (2016), students will read about the impact of poverty on housing. In the selected reading from Linquiti (2022), students will focus on the logos portion of arguments, considering logic and how we gather evidence to support our arguments.

## Unit Assignments

**Read**

- Edin and Shafer (2016) Chapter 3: _A Room of One's Own_
- Linquiti (2022) Chapter 5: _Using Logic to Identify Tentative Truths_
- Linquiti (2022) Chapter 6: _Collecting and Evaluating Evidence for Use in Policy Analysis_

**A-01 Weekly Online Discussion Forum**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are six forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **four replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- [Reflection on Challenges of Housing in the $2 per Day Community](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_616-622.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=f73df263-cd5b-441d-8916-18591b3059d6) is a forum where students can reflect on their reading in chapter three and/or share examples of the impact poverty has on housing.
- There are forums for the added discussion questions at the end of each chapter, [Chapter Five Discussion Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_616-622.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=7831fce6-4061-4b08-9a4d-0e561d69632b) and [Chapter Six Discussion Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_616-622.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=6b869a2a-b41d-4b89-80dc-a85d823d2aa3).
- [Reasoning Examples](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_616-622.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=1aebd2b9-5117-4391-a063-9148f16ca824) provides a space for students to define methods of reasoning and give an example.
- Students should be working on their papers for this class. [Identification of Evidence Related to Your Social Policy Paper](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_616-622.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=957fd5a3-b016-464e-a9cb-52f3c725d14b) is a place for students to share some of their thinking and planning related to this.
- In the forum, [Characterization of Advocates versus Policy Analysis Professionals](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/ðŸ’»_W-04_616-622.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=92952e0b-4840-4820-ab71-c5dc9bfc6beb), I ask students to consider the discussion in the textbook and their alignment.

**A-03 Take Home Exam 01**

You can find [A-03 - Take Home Exam 01](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_588/2425_SU-SOWK_588-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=0fc6b7db-571c-4d17-af75-f1cd68492db2). It is due Monday, 6/23 at 8 am. If you have already completed it, you may consider retaking it. People originally requested that another CRT question be included. I don't have one of those, but I have a silly riddle that, if you answer correctly, you can earn some extra credit.
