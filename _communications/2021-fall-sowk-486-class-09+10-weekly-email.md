I hope you are all having a wonderful week. I am including class information for Weeks nine and 10. There were a bunch of slides for week nine that we didn't get into. I'm also excited to get two weeks for us to dive into planning.


# Week 10

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Planning is an integral part of the process of working with clients. As the adage goes, "failing to plan is planning to fail." There is a lot we can do to help our clients plan, and even the process of teaching them to prepare can have positive long-term impacts. Today, we will spend time looking at goals, cognitive distortions and practice going through an eight-step process for planning.

The schedule is:

- Information about goals
- The eight steps to planning
- Practice doing the planning process

## Unit Resources

Almost everybody has heard of Maslow (1943) and the hierarchy of needs. It is a highly influential article that has been expanded upon for generations. We will be talking some about the needs, as they are interrelated with the goals and planning we must do as social workers. I'd encourage you to read the article.

# Week 09
  
## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week nine is a continuation of the work we started in week seven and looking at assessments. The focus is diving more into social histories, with an opportunity to practice asking questions related to this in small groups. As well, students do their teach-back activity if there is time we will do some activities around genograms and eco-maps.
