## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week six is synchronous with having class on Saturday (10/04/25) for SOWK 590. Students continue to work at the practicum and will submit their weekly journal. We will have the following agenda:

- SLED: Self-Care and Burnout Prevention
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students consider self-care and burnout prevention, and how these concepts relate to their practice.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students will recognize the shared experiences of their peers in the practicum and be able to utilize the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
