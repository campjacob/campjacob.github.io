Hey, next week is almost here! Have a wonderful weekend.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week nine is a synchronous week, with class on 10/19. The readings will be about relational theory. I might also have a discussion related to behavioral therapy (which is the content of week 10).


## Unit Assignments

**Reading**

- Read Cooper and Granucci Lesser's (2022) Chapter 7 Relational Theory

**Weekly Online Discussion Forums**

This week, there are four discussion forums for you to engage in. I want you to make a total of **three replies** across any of the forums. I want at least two of the replies related to any of the prompts. The other reply can be answering prompts or replying to your peers. The following is a brief overview of the forums for this week:

- The [chapter seven reflections questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/üè´_W-09_1014_-_1020.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=526a91c8-d7f1-425d-b13c-2c7c69e732ec) forum explores the readings and you to consider identity, developmental models, understanding a third space, and how this might be applied to a group.
- The forum [self-disclosure](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/üè´_W-09_1014_-_1020.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=a42182ad-1606-4e54-a15d-3f3a02f178a9) gives a space to talk about intersubjectivity and self-disclosure.
- [Transference and countertransference](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/üè´_W-09_1014_-_1020.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=edbb0518-b203-4bd2-a7cd-6be378d96d85) to be able to talk about the impact this has on our therapeutic relationships.

While you don't have to post in all the forums, I expect you to read all the posts across all the forums. Your forums are due before Saturday (10/19 at 8 AM).

**Reading Quizzes**

During my first section of this class, they earned a stump the professor extra credit point for me getting one of the quiz questions wrong earlier this semester. Last week they tried again, but I prevailed and answered the question correctly. Knowing that they were hoping for some extra credit and that I don't have any designated assignments, I am making [W-09 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 07](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=7b82e8bf-4da5-4392-bdde-f4d83ae3116f) worth only extra credit (e.g., you can do it or not... but if you do the points help your grade). It is still due at the same time, by 8 AM on Saturday, 10/19.

**Midterm Evaluation**

I haven't gotten much feedback yet, so please complete the [SOWK 581 (0) Midterm Evaluation](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=592D6B7C-DCF0-497B-97D1-1FDCC1DCB7DC&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=50NOHED316). I would love to hear feedback about how this class is going and what I can do to improve your experience.
