We are starting a three week set of classwork for your presentations. I hope you are all doing well. I know group work can be challenging. Let me know if your group is struggling.


## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

I have designated week six to provide students with space to work on their presentations for weeks seven and eight. There is no required reading from the textbook to provide extra capacity and time for preparing for your presentation next week. There is only one forum reply this week.

The objectives this week include the following:

- Understand the criteria for group presentation assignment
- Present references used in your presentation for review
- Prepare presentations for week seven

## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Spend some time browsing the [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines) Website or [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html)
- Watch my video, [Hierarchy in Academic Sources and Researching Advice for Social Work Students](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2022/02/hierarchy-in-academic-sources-and-researching-advice-for-social-work-students/)
- If you need a refresher about the assignment, watch [Spring 2024 SOWK 322 - Week 02](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2f17fcd2-db63-4de5-b08d-b0fd0178f953) lecture video where I introduced the assignment

**Aâ€“01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

For week six, students only have to make one reply for their weekly participation. The expectation is that you will spend your time interacting with your group this week and preparing your presentations. I expect everybody to participate with your group members and fairly distribute the work. At the end of week eight, you must complete a "quiz" asking for your self-report and reflection on what you did in your project. You can see this at [A-03b: Group Presentation Self-Reflection Questionnaire](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=0563d600-1746-464f-9cd8-a9e2f6514f13). For week six, I have also created a forum where students can optionally post questions or needs that they have. You can also contact me directly, and I will respond.

The following are the two forums available in week six:

- The one place you are required to post at least one reply to is the forum, [Sharing High-Quality Source with Context](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-06_219_-_225.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=8a110e62-6fc8-4bf1-b323-dace69fb4aa7). This forum asks you to share one of the sources you have been reading for your presentation along with some context.
- You can also post to the forum [Last Minute Questions About the Presentation](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/W-06_219_-_225.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=a8ca7ddf-b77d-40b1-9b6f-9e83a8f61a83)

## Unit Resources

While it is the same information that is in the syllabus, there is a handout - [Assignment 03: Disability Population Group Presentation Description](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=a985ea67-9790-405a-857d-95407f718545). You can also see the [Group Assignments for Assignment 03](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=4bf77c7b-2ca2-4335-95f8-75557119b3fb), [Groups 1-3 Assignment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=dbeae6d5-1e15-4bb6-b070-493729121b64)/[Groups 4-6 Assignment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=f95bc55a-d3eb-4495-ad04-a7316e20bf0f) as well as [A-03b: Group Presentation Self-Reflection Questionnaire](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_322/2324_SP-SOWK_322-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=0563d600-1746-464f-9cd8-a9e2f6514f13) that will be due after the presentations are all completed, on Sunday 03/10/24 at 11:55 PM.

As described in the assignment grading rubric, your presentations must include a couple of types of sources. This includes using your textbook and at least two high-quality sources. In social work, we employ the style guide provided by the American Psychological Association (APA, 2019). Some of you who are not social work majors may be new to writing like this, and I find many students feel a little intimidated by APA. For your presentation, you should use in-text citations to show where you got information in your slides, and there should be at least one slide with your references (if you need multiple slides, that is also OK). While the official standards for APA are all found in the APA (2019) publication manual, I want to provide a couple of resources that can be helpful.

With the publication of the seventh edition of their publication manual, the American Psychological Association made a significant update to their website. The [Style and Grammar Guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines) provide a great deal of information previously only included in the published manual. When people talk about following APA style, they often are only thinking about [in-text citations](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations), [reference list entries](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references), and how to [format a paper](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/sample-papers). The style guide also looks at how we actually write, including attempting to be [bias free](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language) and specific [writing](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/mechanics-style) / [grammar](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar) styles. I think the challenging thing about APA style sometimes is that it tends to be particular. Examples of this include the use of [italic in a reference list](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/basic-principles) or providing a [page number for direct quotes](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/quotations). For the reference list, as you are starting, I would suggest looking up each source type and following the examples, and after doing this multiple times, it will begin to make sense how they are formatted. Another excellent source that you can look at is the Online Writing Lab (OWL) from Purdue University. Their [APA Formatting and Style Guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html) is well put together, and if you find the APA Style's website more challenging to understand, this might be easier to get.

In thinking about types of sources and what makes a high-quality source, I have put together a video, [Hierarchy in Academic Sources and Advice for Social Work Students](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2022/02/hierarchy-in-academic-sources-and-researching-advice-for-social-work-students/).
