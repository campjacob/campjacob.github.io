I hope you are all well. I had a fabulous conference last week, although it was long and busy. I'm looking forward class. We are going spend the start of class going through registration. If you have questions around this, Jessica and I should be there before as well and we can help talk through it.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Planning is an integral part of the process of working with clients. As the adage goes, "failing to plan is planning to fail." We can do a lot to help our clients plan, and even the process of teaching them to prepare can have positive long-term impacts. Today, we will look at goals and cognitive distortions and practice going through a six-stage process for planning.

The schedule is as follows:

- Information about goals
- The six steps in planning
- Practice doing the planning process
