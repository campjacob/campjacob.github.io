I hope that you are all doing well and staying safe. Just a reminder that we have class tonight at 5:30 pm. I think it should be a good class, and I have some activities related to working with families that will hopefully help support you all. 

Last week we spent some time discussing using strengths perspective with families. I also made a video and posted it to YoutTube for all of you. Sorry to be so slow at getting these out for you you, but it takes me a long time to make these, and I hope it's useful for you.

This week we will be spending some time talking about skills that we might use to teach families, and we are going to be talking a little bit about Operant Conditioning. I made a video - Changing Problematic Behaviors, Principles of Operant Conditioning a while back about this topic, and you might benefit from seeing it as well.

The readings for this week and last week were listed in the syllabus. The link for the Chovil one is a direct link and takes you to the pdf. The Prest and Protinsky can be found by searching for it in the Heritage Library. They are interesting articles, and I would encourage you to read them, but they are not necessary to read as a part of class tonight.

If you are interested, I also made a fun stop motion video with my kids. I thought I would share it here as well:
