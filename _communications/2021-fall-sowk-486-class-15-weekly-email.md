I hope everybody is doing well. This is our last week of regular course work. In looking, there are still a number of you who have not done the reading quiz yet for this week, so I have extended it to be do on Friday as well.


## What You Will Learn

Week 15 rounds out the rest of the semester, which we have been focusing on working with individuals. This week, we consider how we do case advocacy and how we begin to create change within social policy. The plan for the class is:

- What is advocacy, and why do we do it
- Making the connection between micro-practice and macro-practice
- Skills for Policy Practice
- Knowing what to change within an organization


## Unit Resources

I created a video a while back about [Working with Vulnerable Populations, a Rationale for Social Work Policy Practice](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/01/working-vulnerable-populations-rationale-social-work-policy-practice/) that helps talk about why we should be thinking about policy practice.

**Purpose**: The Interviewing skills Video Role-Play Reflective Paper offers students a chance to reflect on the experience of their role-play after having watched themselves using a critical eye. 

**Task**: The second component of this assignment is an individually authored reflective paper regarding the process. Students are to review the role-play recording they completed and write a reflective essay describing your experience and what you learned from watching the recording. The reflective paper rubric describes how the paper will be evaluated. The paper should be between 500 and 750 words in length, formatted in APA. Abstracts are optional, and if your paper does not cite any sources, there is no need for a reference page. The following should be included in your paper:

- **Areas of Strengths**: The paper should include a discussion of your areas of strength demonstrated in the role-play. For example, “I used attentive body language because I leaned in slightly and maintained eye contact.” Be specific about what went well. Include quotes from either party.
- **Areas for Improvement**: The paper should also include a discussion of your areas for improvement. Again, be specific and use concrete language. State how you will work on these skills.

**Success**:  Students will submit a paper that demonstrates their ability to self-reflect and to write using strong academic writing skills. Grades are assigned based on the reflective paper rubric. Feedback will be provided with final grades which are due by the instructor no later than 12/15/21 at 5:00 PM.
