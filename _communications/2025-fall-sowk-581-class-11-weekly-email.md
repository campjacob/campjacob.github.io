I hope you are all doing well! I'm excited to see you all two weeks in a row. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 is a synchronous week, with class on 11/8. I will update this later as we get closer.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 11 - _Solution Focused Therapy_

**W-11 A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are three forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **3 replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- The [Chapter 11 Reflection Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-11_113-119.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=fbc3fbdb-b593-44cb-b18d-f00f63c1e6d6) forum invites students to dive into solution-focused therapy concepts by choosing from a list of applied reflection questions based on the Drew family case study and related clinical strategies.
- In [Comparing SFT and Motivational Interviewing](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-11_113-119.jnz), students examine both similarities and distinctions between these two strengths-based, client-centered approaches—highlighting implementation, philosophy, and potential integration in social work practice.
- The forum [Developing a Case Example Based on a DSM Diagnosis](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/🏫_W-11_113-119.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=32936104-b45d-471f-912c-cd535e75646f) challenges students to select a DSM diagnosis, construct a client vignette, and explore diagnostic reasoning within a person-in-environment framework.

**A-03 Chapter Reading Quizzes**

[W-11 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 11](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=d5029473-e759-4a9b-be34-07d0ef412d8c) is due by Saturday 11/8, 8:00 AM.


## Unit Resources

As discussed, I have created a podcast for the readings using Google Notebook LM. I am using this as a pilot and would like feedback on whether people like this. I can try doing it for all of my textbooks and having different podcasts for each. But it is extra work I wouldn't want to do if people aren't interested. To add the podcast to your podcast app, see the article [How do you manually add a podcast feed to iOS and Android](https://transistor.fm/add-podcast/), which walks you through the process using many different systems. The URL you would use is [the RSS feed](https://vsp.ink/deep-dive-cooper-and-granucci-lesser-2022.xml). I will do this for this semester, and I am hoping for some feedback on whether anybody finds it helpful. I hope that you try it out.

You can listen to a podcast episode for this week's reading [Chapter 11: Solution-Focused Therapy](https://vsp.ink/podcasts/deep-dive-cooper-and-granucci-lesser-2022/11-solution-focused-therapy/), or see the entire series [Podcast Series](https://vsp.ink/deep-dive-cooper-and-granucci-lesser-2022/).

I'll include slides/handouts here as we get closer to class.

The [Lecture Videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Lecture_Videos.jnz) tab in the MyHeritage course is where you will be able to find class recordings. The video this week is at `[Fall 2025 SOWK 581 Week 11]()`.
