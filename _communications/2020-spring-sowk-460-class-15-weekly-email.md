I hope you are all doing well today. I'm feeling much better today. We will have class, I don't think it should go on too long I want to spend some time talking about dissemination and your final projects. Next week there is no class, as people will be posting and making replies to peoples projects instead of class. We can talk today if we want to have the last meeting on Finals week to wrap things up or if you guys would like to just be done with school! Congratulations on making it!! Just a little bit more to go.

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
