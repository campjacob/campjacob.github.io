## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 11 is synchronous with having class on Saturday (11/08/25) for SOWK 590. Students continue to work at the practicum and will submit their weekly journal. We will have the following agenda:

- SLED: Cultural Competence in Practice
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students consider cultural competence in practice.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students will recognize peers' shared experiences in their practicum and use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.

## Unit Resources

I shared about Harborview Abuse & Trauma Center has their [CBT + NOTEBOOK](https://depts.washington.edu/uwhatc/cbt-notebook/) in 581 last week. We are going to do an activity tangentially related to the turtle technique that they offer for our mindfulness activity during class. I'm pairing this activity with coloring exercise that we will be doing. If you are interested in an interesting literature review related to art based mindfulness and it's its impact on anxeity Zhu et al. (2025) is somewhere you could start. You can find the article and Turtle Technique with Coloring Mandala as an attached handout.
