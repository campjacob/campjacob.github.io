I hope that you have all had a wonderful long holiday and were able to spend some time today thinking about Martin Luther King Jr and the topic of social justice that is so related to social work.

Week two is all about the theoretical and philosophical foundations of working with groups. We review content from Tosland (2017) _Chapter 1 - Group Dynamics_, Tropman (2017) _Chapter 2 - An Ecological/Systems/Seven C's Perspective on Groups_ and Smith et al. (2017) _Chapter 3 - Social Group Work in a Global Context_. We discuss an overview of working with groups, group dynamics, and group roles during this review. We also participate in online group experience.

The agenda for this week is as follows:

- Overview of working with groups
- Group dynamics and roles
- Tools and strategies in groups

**Purpose**: During the second half of the semester, students will write about evidence-based practices for doing groups with a specific population. 

**Task**: Toseland (2017) describes the domains of group dynamics as including (1) communication processes and interaction patterns, (2) interpersonal attraction and cohesion, (3) social integration and influence, (4) power and control, and (5) culture. Students will pick one of these areas and make connections to a population that they see themselves working in. Write about what you might expect to see in working with that population-related to these topics.

**Criterion for Success**: Students will post a discussion forum post on time, which is a couple of paragraphs in length. They will use strong academic writing and proper citations.
