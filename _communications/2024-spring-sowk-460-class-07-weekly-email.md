I hope you are all doing well. I'm feeling a bit under the weather. I don't want to cancel class, but we are going to meet this week online via zoom. See link below to join.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week seven, we will continue considering our logic models submitted last week. We will be delving into how we develop a program description. When we write our executive summary, it will include your logic model as a figure, but there will also be a narrative description sharing the needs the program is addressing, the context of the program, what population served by the program, the stage of development of the program, agency resources/activities/outputs/outcomes/impacts. As students have been developing their program evaluation, they are encouraged to start considering these inter-related questions. The agenda for the class session this week is as follows:

- A brief presentation about the MSW program by Dr. Juarez
- Planning for presentations
- Reviewing process for logic model development
- Developing a rubric for our logic models
- How we can develop a program description from our logic models
