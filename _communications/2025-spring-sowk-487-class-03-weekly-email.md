I hope that you all have a wonderful weekend. The following is the course content for week three.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week three, we continue to learn about working with families. We move beyond assessment and understanding to how we can work with families and some skills for enhancing relationships. Students will read chapter 15 of Hepworth et al. (2022). Next, we will dive into family engagement and first- and second-order strategies for families.


The agenda will be as follows:

- Review the family system framework

- Practice with starting services
- Implementing first/second order strategies
