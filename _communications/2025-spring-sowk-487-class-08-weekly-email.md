## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Social work groups require the consideration of the dynamics of group development, intervention strategies, and ethics, which are all the focus of week eight. Students will read Hepworth et al. (2022) and their chapter regarding facilitating social work groups, which provides insight into stages of group development. We spent most of our time last week doing family treatment presentations. We have two more this week, and then we will make further connections to group dynamics and interventions in group work. Students will have an opportunity to meet as teams and work on their group facilitation activities. We will have an example of an empowerment group and some small group discussions on how to understand ethical decisions in group work and planning. The agenda for class is as follows:

- Family treatment modality research presentations
- Group dynamics in social work facilitation
- Time to work on group facilitation activity
- Empowerment groups
- Ethics in group work
- Planning and implementing of social work groups

## Unit Resources

If you didn't complete your midterm feedback, please do so - [Spring 2025 Midterm Feedback for SOWK 487 Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=BA87C336-3D36-4861-A385-E14B5EB9F204&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=D0KEKIY306). 

The [Arc of Tri-Cities](https://arcoftricities.com) helps to put on the event [Our Autism Journey We're Better Together](https://www.ourautismjourneytc.com). Last year, some students did their group facilitation project there, and that can be an option for you to consider. I would also give extra credit for students who volunteer for the event. It is a great event to support and raise awareness regarding autism. If you plan to help at the event, you must complete a background check, so you should follow up with the Arc about your desire to help. The actual event is on April 12th.

There are three excerpts from some texts that we will be using in class this week in our discussion regarding ethical dilemmas. Garland (2010), Goodrich and Luke (2015), and Pawlukewicz and Ondrus (2013) are attached as handouts, but I will also bring some printed copies.

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Spring 2025 SOWK 487w Week 08 - Facilitating Social Work Groups](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/vDz3ny).
