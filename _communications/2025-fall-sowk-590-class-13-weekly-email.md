This week is the last in-person class session.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 13 is synchronous with having class on Saturday (11/22/25) for SOWK 590. Students continue to work at the practicum and will submit their weekly journal. We will have the following agenda:

- SLED: Ethical Considerations in Social Media Use
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students consider ethical considerations in social media use in practice.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students will recognize peers' shared experiences in their practicum and use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.

**Start Planning Midpoint Evaluation**

You should start to plan your Midpoint Evaluation. As you are meeting with your supervisor this week or next, be thinking about when you want to schedule the meeting. Send me a message to see if it will work.

## Unit Resources

If you are working in a school (or just interested), I was in my general coalition meeting for the Pasco Prevention Network, and they shared about free training, [Spanish Youth Mental Health First Aid](https://www.pdenroller.org/esd123/catalog/event/195344). It is facilitated in Spanish but might be of interest to some of you. If you decide to do so, let me know.

We will be doing progressive muscle relaxation for our mindfulness activity this week. I am going to use a video from the Therapist Aid (2014) [How to do Progressive Muscle Relaxation](https://youtu.be/1nZEdqcGVzo). You can also find a meta-analysis of the efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation [Muhammad Khir et al. (2024)](https://www.dovepress.com/article/download/90149).
