I hope your week is going well and I will see everyone on Saturday!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Tailoring our practices to be responsive to the cultural needs of our clients helps us to develop strong relationships with our clients, improve engagement and client outcomes, and gives a direction to address barriers and biases. Week seven for SOWK 587 is focused on culturally responsive practices in schools and takes place synchronously on Saturday (03/08/25). Reading from Jarolmen and Bautista-Thomas (2023) focuses on developing self-awareness in cultural competence, culturally responsive practice, and cultural humility within anti-oppressive frameworks. It also provides some tools and ideas for working with different populations. I also ask you to read Davidson Cowling (2018), which explores culturally responsive practices with indigenous populations.

Further information about specific content for the class will be provided before class.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Jarolmen and Bautista-Thomas (2023) _Chapter 7: Being a Culturally Responsive  School Social Worker_
- Davidson Cowling (2018) _Culturally Responsive Social Work Methods for Use With Indigenous People_

**A-02 Asynchronous Weekly Small Groups Discussion Forums**

This week, I do not have forums to give my students and me extra space to catch up on the coursework. I intend to make some good progress on grading. During week three, we had some great discussions and content related to School culture and creating an environment that fosters safety, health, and learning for students ([Schools as Organizationsâ€”Understanding the Landscape](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/UxOQ4E)).

## Unit Resources

The Library has provided some online guides on populations and social work practice. You can find [Latinx Social Work](https://libguides.heritage.edu/c.php?g=1361830) and [Native Americans & Social Work Tabs](https://libguides.heritage.edu/c.php?g=99690&p=9788535), which have a lot of content that you can explore.

During class, we will explore Mental Health America's resources on [communities of color](https://www.mhanational.org/bipoc-communities-of-color).

I will upload the presentation for this week here before class and the video after class.
