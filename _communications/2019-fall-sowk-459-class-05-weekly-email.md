I hope that you are all well. Just a couple of reminders about this week. First remember that there is __no class for week five (both the Tuesday and Thursday class)__. The idea to give you some purposeful time to work both on your peer reviews and start your annotated bibliography. I have gone through and randomly allocated all of you to have two of your peers to review their theoretical framework and and to review your own theoretical framework. There is no reading that due for this week. Have a wonderful week and I will see all of you next week.
