## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 10 for SOWK 591 is synchronous, with class on Saturday (03/29/25). Students will reflect on their practicum experience in their journals. During class, we will have a student-led discussion regarding critical thinking, engage in mindfulness through breathing, and participate in a group reflecting on their practice. The following is the agenda:

- SLED: Critical Thinking
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will provide feedback to help guide this course.
- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider critical thinking and its application to practice.

## Unit Assignments

**Attendance and In-Class Participation**

Attend class on Saturday.

**Weekly Reflective Journals**

Complete the [W-10 A-02 Reflective Journal](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_591/2425_SP-SOWK_591-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=72c7f1f5-a393-47f4-a66c-44f7bc384622) by Monday 8 AM.

**Hour Log**

Submit your hour log [March Practicum Hours](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_596/2425_SP-SOWK_596-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=d9454089-8997-42f8-b0c0-11609d47044c) found in SOWK 596 and due no later than 04/15/25 at 5 PM. I recommend taking it to your next supervision meeting so you can review it, get it signed, and then submit it. The intention of giving you until midway through the month is so that you have plenty of time for your supervisor to review the hours with you.

**Student-Led Discussion**

If you signed up to facilitate the SLED "Critical Thinking" session, please be prepared to review it in class.

## Unit Resources

Yoga is a mindfulness-related practice. We will follow along with [Chair Yoga For Slowing Down - 10 Minute Kids Yoga Class with Yoga Ed. - Ages 3-12 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbhr0TMmg9I) during class. If you don't currently have a personal practice, I'd highly recommend it. There are also programs for implementation in school settings. For example, [Yoga for Classrooms - Creating Mindful Classrooms](https://yoga4classrooms.com/).

There are a great deal of articles and sources focused on yoga. I'm sharing two. First, Schure et al. (2008) describe the results of an intensive class for counselors that included a yoga component where participants described increasing awareness of their bodies, flexibility, and mental clarity and concentration. Second is Ferreira-Vorkapic et al. (2015), who systematically reviewed programs implementing yoga in school through randomized controlled studies.

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Spring 2025 SOWK 591 Week 10 - Advanced Seminar II](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/seHmBI).
