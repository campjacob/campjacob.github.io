**Start Planning Midpoint Evaluation**

You should start to plan your Midpoint Evaluation. As you are meeting with your supervisor this week or next be thinking about when you want to schedule the meeting send me a message to see if it will work.

## Unit Resources

Corey Hodge, our VP of Student Affairs (and former social work chair) shared Guidelines regarding ICE interactions in an email that I believe went out to all faculty, staff, and students. It described the following:

**Students Participating in Clinicals or Practicums**

As you participate in off-campus internships, practica, clinicals, and other experiences, we want to ensure you are prepared to handle any potential interactions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Please review the following guidance carefully:
 
1. Alert Your Supervisor <br>
	If ICE agents approach you or enter your workplace, immediately alert your supervisor. They are responsible for handling such situations and ensuring the safety of everyone at the site.
2. Do Not Divulge Unnecessary Information<br>
	You are not required to answer questions or provide information to ICE agents. If approached, politely but firmly state that you need to notify your supervisor.
3. Know Your Rights<br>
	a. ICE agents cannot enter private areas of a workplace without a judicial warrant (signed by a judge).<br>
	b. Administrative warrants do not require compliance. <br>
	c. If a judicial warrant is presented and someone is detained, remind them to stay silent and ask for an attorney.<br>
4. Stay Calm and Composed<br>
	If an interaction occurs, remain calm and follow your workplace protocols. Your safety and the safety of others is the priority.
