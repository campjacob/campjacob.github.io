I hope you all have been enjoying this class so far. This is a reminder that the discussion forums are an important aspect of this class. My expectation is that you start posting early in the week so that there can be some back-and-forth discussion, especially on asynchronous weeks. If you haven't made your posts for week two, please work on those. The forums close on Monday morning, and for the following weeks, they are due on Saturday before class.

This week, there are two discussion forums for you to engage in. I want you to make a total of **three replies**. At least one should be to the prompts in the two forums. The other reply can be related to the prompts or be a dialog between your peers. The two forums we have this week are as follows:
