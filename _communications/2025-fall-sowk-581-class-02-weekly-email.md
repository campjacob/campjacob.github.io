We are onto week two. I'm excited to see everybody on Saturday. Let me know if there is anything I can do for you.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week two is focused on the clinical interview process. Class is synchronous, with our in-person session taking place (09/06/25). You will read Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 02, where you examine the therapeutic process as a whole, divided into stages of treatment, and what working with clients entails. I also ask that you read two journal articles about the DSM and begin exploring your copy of this reference book. There are forums where you can consider diverse perspectives on the DSM and relate to the textbook's content. During the in-person class session, we will be defining clinical practice and our role within the process. The agenda is as follows:

- Defining clinical practice and our roles
- Overview of the clinical interview process
- What happens in the beginning stage of treatment
- Transference and countertransference
- Practice exercise with motivational interviewing
- Middle and end of treatment

The learning objectives for this week include:

- Be exposed to different perspectives on DSM and the medical model.
- Students will be able to analyze the concept of impostor syndrome and its impact on new clinicians.
- Define the concepts of transference and countertransference.
- Understand the stages of the change model and relate it to the therapeutic process of treatment.
- Explain some of the considerations in the different phases of the treatment process. 
- Experience a conversation that is not motivational interviewing, and one that is more in line with the principles of motivational interviewing.

## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 2: _The Clinical Interview: The Process of Assessment_
- Read Barsky (2015) _DSM-5 and the Ethics of Diagnosis_
- Read Robbins (2014) _From the Editor‚ÄîThe DSM-5 and its Role in Social Work Assessment and Research_
- Explore the library guides

**A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are four forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **three replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- One of the underlying ideas of this book is taking an integrated approach to your direct practice with individuals, families, and groups. I ask you to reflect on this approach in [Considering an Integrated Approach](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/üè´_W-02_91-97.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=18f93aae-aa68-42b6-80e0-5d6113efd0ef).
- The authors provide some reflection questions you can respond to [Chapter 02 Reflection Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/üè´_W-02_91-97.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=e361e83e-aeab-41f5-813f-7ab0e2d2ae6a).
- Some social workers consider the use of the DSM for assessment to be controversial. Before we use it, I first want you to consider some [Challenges and Problems with the DSM](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/üè´_W-02_91-97.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=64deeb70-1bdc-46b6-8c5b-ec4195ddcb14).
- A spirit of exploration and interest is a positive quality. The forum [Initial Exploration of the DSM-5-TR](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/üè´_W-02_91-97.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=4de74e71-7f4d-46e4-af2a-8e2039984d72) encourages you to share about looking through the reference book you bought.

**A-03: Chapter Reading Quizzes**

Complete [W-02 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 02](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=522fecbc-7a36-432a-9b31-bfbf33605b72) by Saturday 9/6, 8:00 AM.

## Unit Resources

As an MSW program, we have developed a few library guides. You can find library guides on [Native Americans and Social Work](https://libguides.heritage.edu/c.php?g=99690&p=9788535) and [Latinos and Social Work](https://libguides.heritage.edu/c.php?g=1361830). I'd like for you to explore and familiarize yourself with these guides.

Along with your textbook, we will also begin our examination of the DSM-5-TR. There are readings from Barsky (2015) and Robbins (2014) that explore some of the considerations it is essential for us to have regarding the use and ethics surrounding the DSM. They are attached as handouts. Chapter two of the textbook is also included, as we still do not have physical books to distribute to you for this.

During class, I give students a handout titled "Considering Our Thoughts." It asks students to consider negative thoughts or self-doubts they have going into their practicum and later into practice, and to consider how they can replace some of these thoughts. 

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Fall 2025 SOWK 581 Week 02 - The Clinical Interview Process](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/PjE3sJ).

The [Lecture Videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Lecture_Videos.jnz) tab in the MyHeritage course is where you will be able to find class recordings. The video this week is at `[Fall 2025 SOWK 581 Week 02]()`.
