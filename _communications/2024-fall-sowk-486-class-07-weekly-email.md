## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week seven and the topic of counterproductive communication builds on week six, which generally looks at just skills related to communication. Communication happens all of the time, and through both verbal and nonverbal patterns. As social workers, we have an obligation to look at how we are communicating and make an attempt to not be putting up barriers to have communication flow freely. The agenda for class this week is as follows:

- Parts and best practices of verbal and nonverbal communication 
- Reflective responding
- Barriers to communication
