Last regular week of class and no required reading quiz (offered as extra credit). Bittersweet?

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 16 is the final week of class. We will be reviewing evaluations within group work. My dissertation, Campbell (2023) was based on participatory action research (PAR). I provide McDonald (2012) as a primer to doing PAR as a methodology social work group research. During week 15 we spend time looking at Community-Based Participatory Research Partnerships (CBPR) in the context of best practices for working with groups. The reading in Teufel-Shone et al. (2018) provides more of a understanding of what these groups look like, especially from the context of a group. The following are the topics for this session.

The agenda for this week is as follows:

- Evaluation designs for groups
- Difference between program evaluation and clinical evaluation
- What is a qualitative design methodology
- Intervention research

## Unit Assignments

**Read/Watch**

- Read Teufel-Shone et al. (2018) and MacDonald (2012)

**A-01: Class Engagement and Attendance**

Attend Class

**A-02: Reading Engagement**

I messed up. I had a quiz developed for this week, but I never added it to My Heritage. You can still find [A-02: Reading Engagement for Week 16](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2324_SP-SOWK_487W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=TestBuilderView&screenType=change&id=17457f6e-0416-4b0d-994b-2e65a620cbf5), and it due by Sunday via My Heritage Assignments... but **I am making it worth just extra credit** so it is a voluntary assignment that you can get a few extra credit points if you would like. 

**A-04c â€“ Facilitation Reflective Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 100 pts (20% of final grade); _Deadline_ Friday 05/03/24 by 11:55 PM _Completion_ Completed via an upload in assignments on My Heritage. You can find [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=d0b7063a-b022-4b3b-b239-7bb6e1949013) and the [Assignment Page](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2324_SP-SOWK_487W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=0bb8526c-be3f-457e-9c4e-c60d19f69c42).

**Purpose**: Reflecting on an experience can be valuable to demonstrate learning and increase critical thinking skills.

**Task**: Students will write a reflective paper discussing their experience facilitating the group. The reflections do not need to discuss other members' performance or activity. Reflective essays should still follow a research paper's page formatting and tone but should use first-person voice.

**Success**: The paper will be graded based on the reflective paper rubric. The document should be 500-750 words in length. It should be submitted on time, have good grammar, and be professionally formatted.

**A-06a: Group Participation and Reflective Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 25 extra credit points (5% of final grade); _Deadline_ Friday 05/03/24 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ submission via assignments on MyHeritage. You can find [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=97cacf4e-0667-46a3-ab93-8aee0604c547) and the [Assignment Page](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2324_SP-SOWK_487W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=5359d0f8-4169-4ef9-a261-ba3bc4197ee4).

**Purpose**: Offer students an assignment to earn extra credit points where they can reflect on participation in a group and the experience through the lens of social work.

**Task**: The student would participate in a therapeutic or task group and write about their experience. The group would be attending an AA or something similar offered in the community. The group can also be a task group, especially a policy-related group (such as a school board meeting). After attending and observing the group, the student will write a short reflective paper.

**Success**: The reflective paper will be approximately 500 to 750 words. The report will be graded according to the reflective paper rubric included in the syllabus.

**A-06b: Evidence-Based Practices for Culturally Competent Social Work Research Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 50 extra credit points (10% of final grade); _Deadline_ Friday 05/03/24 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ submission via assignments on MyHeritage. You can find [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=923cb9c6-d0d1-4bfa-9b17-5fe7068fab46) and the [Assignment Page](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2324_SP-SOWK_487W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=93ab52f3-f523-42ed-a752-26258642a89f).

**Purpose**: Offer students an assignment to earn more extra credit points where they delve further into evidence-based practices and literature related to cultural competence.

**Task**: This paper reviews evidence-based cultural competency practices for social workers. Students may choose from any given cultural practice to base their research on (some examples could range from how social workers use eye contact in working with clients to best practices for working with a Muslim client). However, the paper will generally describe the following:

- Description of the evidence-based practice being reviewed
- Review of the evidence presented in scholarly sources regarding the practice
- Implications the practice has for social work or for practitioners
- Strengths and limitations of the practice

**Success**: The paper should be written in APA format using strong academic writing and proper formatting. The report should be approximately 1,250 to 1,500 words in length. This paper will be graded according to the APA research paper rubric.
