## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 12 focuses on advancing clinical insight and client change through the use of additive empathy, interpretation, and confrontation. It is an asynchronous week.  The reading from Hepworth et al. (2023) and the lecture content guide students in understanding when and how to use these tools effectively and ethically. The agenda for the lecture video includes:

- Week 12 expectations
- Additive empathy and interpretation

Some of the learning objectives for the week include

- Identify and apply the components of additive empathy and interpretive responses in client interactions.
- Define and differentiate surface empathy, additive empathy, and interpretation in the context of direct social work practice.
- Apply additive empathic responses and interpretive skills to client narratives, demonstrating increased clinical insight.
- Analyze the role of ethical confrontation in client change and practice assertive confrontation using a structured four-part model.
- Create visual or written tools (e.g., handouts, infographics) to communicate core concepts for peer and client education.
