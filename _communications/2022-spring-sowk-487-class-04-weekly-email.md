## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn for Week Four

[Week four](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2122_SP-SOWK_487W-2/W-04_27_â€”_213.jnz?pvt_d761b98a-218c-4b09-981d-0bb0777b0769=List) students read through chapters four, five, and six of the Garvin textbook. These include chapters focused on Brenton (2017) and empowerment perspective in groups, Barksy and Northern (2017) and ethics and values in group work, and finally, Ortega (2017) social justice practice. To start the class session, we will be completing an activity to demonstrate power dynamics, talk about empowerment perspective, and do an activity related to social justice. 

The agenda for today includes looking at

- Empowerment theory
- Ethics and social justice

## Unit Resources

You **need to read** chapters 4-6. If you don't finish prior to class it is OK, but I would encourage you to read it this week. They are really great chapters and provide a lot of great information.

During this class session you will need the following:

- A lollipop (although if you don't have one, it won't be a problem)

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class. [SOWK 487 Week 04 - Foundations for Groups Part II](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/jXdJjY)

During class we will be reading through several case examples. If you have a chance to read through the attached documents it could be helpful. These include [Pawlukewicz and Ondrus (2013) article Ethical Dilemmas: The Use of Applied Scenarios in the Helping Professions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=44d95866-e060-40c4-8a6c-aa44e7ec7656), [Garland (2010) and her Vignette D: Verbal Abuse](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=885e6975-fc35-4201-973e-6ed11fad9412), and finally the portion of a chapter from [Goodrich and Luke (2015) where they provide a case example about a starting an empowerment group](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=a48d7a62-ca61-4268-9a61-5eb032e49c23).
