I hope that you are all well. It's been a busy week for me this week. I'm getting the presentation done for tonight and Thursday's class done a bit later than I would like. I have finished going through and reviewing all of your introductions. Here is what I am thinking. Your final grade, that I will put into my heritage will be based on the score I provided in my assessment verses the score that is listed. Especially for this assignment, people were confused by the first part of the rubric (the introducing the topic). I was not specific enough in the lowest score and so many people said that they "introduced the topic" versus "the topic is is clearly introduced." I'll have to update the grades later... probably not today. I've also started going through your theoretical frameworks.

During class this week, we will be reviewing the following article as a part of an in-class assignment. I'm not going to make copies for everybody, but if you would like to print a copy... you can see the reference and a link to download the PDF and print it.

Lloyd, C., King, R., & Chenoweth, L. (2002) Social work, stress and burnout: A review. _Journal of Mental Health, 11_,(3), pp 255-265. [https://doi.org/10.1080/09638230020023642](https://doi.org/10.1080/09638230020023642)

If you can bring a computer or some sort of device to do research on for class this week, it would be recommended. We are going to break up into groups and spend some time doing some actual searching.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. Don't forget to complete the reading quiz found on the MyHeritage class forum. This week the reading is:

- DeCarlo (2018) __Chapter 3__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Reading and understanding scholarly journal articles
- Distinguish between high-quality and low-quality journal articles
- Summarize a journal article

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.

I tweeted about putting together some of the animations of this if you are interested. You can see the animation below:
