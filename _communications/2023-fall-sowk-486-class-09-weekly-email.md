I hope you are all well. I'm looking forward to class this week. Still working on finishing up grading papers. The slides will be posted in My Heritage prior to class this week, but I'm also not quite done with them either.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week nine continues the work we started in week seven and looks at assessments. We will examine our own bias, and students will have a chance to go through and do an implicit bias test. During class, we will discuss social histories, with an opportunity to practice asking questions about this in small groups. Also, students do their teach-back activity. If there is time, we will do some activities around genograms and eco-maps.


## Unit Assignments

**A-01 Class Participation and Attendance**

Attend class. A reminder that we will be doing a teach-back project during class. Students will have time to prepare in class, but you are encouraged to do some preparation before class. The groups are as follows:

- Assessing biophysical Functioning (pp. 168-172)
- Assessing Cognitive/Perceptual Functioning (pp. 172-176)
- Assessing Affective Functioning (pp. 176-180)
- Assessing Behavioral Functioning (pp. 180-182)
- Assessing Environmental System (pp. 182-186)
