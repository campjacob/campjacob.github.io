## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 12 for SOWK 591 is synchronous, with class on Saturday (04/12/25). Students will reflect on their practicum experience in their journals. During class, we will have a student-led discussion regarding conflict resolution, engage in mindfulness through contemplation, and participate in a group reflecting on their practice. The following is the agenda:

- SLED: Conflict Resolution
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students will provide feedback to help guide this course.
- Students will recognize the shared experiences of peers in their practicum and be able to use the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students consider conflict resolution and its application to practice.

## Unit Resources

The Zen cards I will share during class, I had to buy for a class for my doctoral degree. I wrote an article [Transformation, Creativity and Some of the Things I Have Learned](https://jacobrcampbell.com/resources/essays/transformation-creativity-and-some-of-the-things-i-have-learned/) that talked some about the experience and what my instructor called Pee-wee Hermeneutics. We also pulled different cards for each episode of the the podcast I did with my mom, the [Mother Dearest Show](https://motherdearest.show) (should I bring the show back, I actually have episodes I didn't finish editing and got lost working on my Dissertation?).

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Spring 2025 SOWK 591 Week 12 - Advanced Seminar II](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/NNGtSK).
