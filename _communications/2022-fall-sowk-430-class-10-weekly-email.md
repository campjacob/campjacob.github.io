I hope you all have a great week. Let me know if there is anything I can do for you all. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

We start moving away from our focus on the standards in week ten. This week is a primer for what you will be diving into and considering the next several weeks. This week we'll be completing the quiz assignment and introducing a model for decision-making that we'll be using throughout the rest of the semester.

**Week 10 Objectives**

- Demonstrate a working knowledge of the _Code of Ethics_ through earning a satisfactory score on the code exam.
- Begin to utilize the Essential Steps method for addressing ethical issues.
- Utilize case studies to demonstrate critical thinking in complex circumstances.

## Unit Resources

The [NASW Code of Ethics](https://www.socialworkers.org/About/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics/Code-of-Ethics-English) is available online and in your textbook and will be valuable to have nearby when you are doing your exam this week.

You can read the [Essential Steps for Ethical Decision Making](https://www.naswma.org/page/100/Essential-Steps-for-Ethical-Problem-Solving.htm) on the National Association of Social Workers - Massachusetts Chapter (n.d.) website or the sale NASW Press page for Reamer and Conrad (1995).

Go to[The Journal of Social Work Values and Ethics](http://jswve.org/current-issue/) website and sign up to receive a free e-copy of the journal that comes out twice per year. It can be great way to stay current in the field. The current issue focuses a lot on social justice and anti-racist engagement. One article that I found interesting was  Disney and Carnes (2022) who provide a number of specific ethical delemmas and consider how to best respond. Feel free to browse any of the articles listed there.

You can watch all of the [lecture videos for this class](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_430/2223_FA-SOWK_430-2/Lecture_Videos.jnz). Please watch and complete the embedded quiz at [Fall 2022 SOWK 430 Week 10 - Model for Ethical Decision Making](https://heritage.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d5d2cb5e-bee6-4ffd-af98-af37015d8641)

I'm not sure if you all listen to podcasts. I love podcasts and listen to quite a few. I have enjoyed Jonathan Singer's show, The Social Work Podcast for many years. He hasn't been posting as much recently, but there is an excellent catalog of previous shows. It also appears that the show has been purchased or moved to [The New Social Worker Magazine website](https://www.socialworker.com/Social_Work_Podcast/). I personally listen to podcasts using my iPhone using the [Overcast app](https://overcast.fm), but you can find the show using the [Apple Podcast App](https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts/) or the [Google Podcast App](https://podcasts.google.com). The episode I'm having you listen to this week was published in 2013 by Singer, which is Episode 78, and titled "Social Work Ethics: Interview with Allan Barsky, JD, MSW, PhD." While the website is not functioning anymore, you can read the transcript and see its original posting through the [way back machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20211019044958/https://socialworkpodcast.blogspot.com/2013/03/social-work-ethics-interview-with-allan.html).
