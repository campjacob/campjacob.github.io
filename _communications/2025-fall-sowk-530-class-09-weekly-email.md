## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week nine is asynchronous and marks a move away from assessing and understanding families (a specific type of group) to a two week unit exploring group work. Students will read Hepworth et al (2023) and their chapter about understanding group work. There are forums related to providing personal examples and participation in various types of group work, exploring the similarities/differences between family and group work, and connecting group norms to the social work orienting perspectives. In my lecture video we are going to discuss assessing group behavior and some examples of constructive verses problematic group work. During my lecture video I will speaking on some content from the textbook regarding evaluating groups.

**Agenda**

- Week nine content
- Group dynamics
- Assessing group patterned behavior

**Learning objectives for the week include**

- Recognize patterned behaviors in group members and evaluate their impact on group cohesion and goal attainment.
- Compare and contrast constructive and problematic group behaviors and propose strategies to support healthy group dynamics.
- Reflect on content from the textbook
- Analyze group dynamics, including norms, roles, and patterns of behavior, through the lens of social work orienting perspectives (e.g., strengths, cultural humility, trauma-informed practice).  
- Evaluate task group functioning by examining decision-making, power dynamics, and group processes to improve effectiveness and cohesion.
