## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week eight marks the end of this class and also the MSW program. The content is asynchronous. Final grades are due to the instructor by next Wednesday, 7/23. Students will read content about systems thinking and future planning. There are forums where you can respond to questions from the textbook and practice diagramming systems. An online quiz will provide a space for students to demonstrate their learning from the coursework. Student also have a forum to share their future directions and key learning from the program.

The learning objectives for this week include:

- Apply systems thinking to analyze complex policy problems and visualize interrelated components through diagramming techniques.
- Critically evaluate the benefits and limitations of tools such as problem trees, influence diagrams, and causal loops in policy analysis.
- Utilize forecasting methods to assess future outcomes and unintended consequences of social policy interventions.
- Demonstrate integrative learning by reflecting on personal and professional growth across the MSW program and articulating future goals as practitioners.
- Synthesize key insights from *Rebooting Policy Analysis* and relate them to real-world practice contexts.
- Assess understanding of course content through a comprehensive take-home exam focused on applied policy analysis.
