We are getting really close to the end of the semester. I hope that you are all are ready to talk about termination of work we do with our clients and the evaluation process that we can do in our practice.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Assessments are in important aspect of social work and direct practice with clients. We should be participating in assessments of our own practice and the interventions that we complete with clients. There are a number of ways about going through that. The agenda for today is to look at the following:

-  Evaluation
-  The evaluation process
-  Terminationa
-  Follow up
-  Self Care


## Unit Resources

We are talking about assessment in class this week. It is also time for the assessment of the class. I do really value feedback. So much that I am asking you to verbally give feedback in the FlipGrid video, but also using the course assessment tool provided by Heritage University. The results of the survey tool are confidential so I don't receive any names related to specific responses.  There should be a spot for you to be able to take the evaluation on the sidebar or [CourseEval](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Faculty/CoursEval.jnz) (link might work, it does for me).

You can find all of the presentations for this course at [presentation.jacobrcampbell.com](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com). Week 14 [Evaluation and Termination](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/BGbmNn)
