## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

During week 16, we will have groups complete their presentations and share them with their classmates, members of the university community, and workers for their practicum placements. Students will be able to demonstrate scholarly presentation skills and share practical assessments and recommendations compiled from their program evaluations.

**A-04d: Executive Summary of the Program Evaluation**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 200 pts (20% of student's final grade); _Deadline_ Monday 05/12/25 by 08:00 AM; _Submission_ via Anthology through the assignments section of MyHeritage; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=c85c81fb-8e4a-4217-8662-1da8c4d402dd), [Executive Summary Template.docx](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=ddf6a6d5-05d6-4ef9-a424-d5400986ea71), and [Syllabus Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=0da00da7-d7e8-4c18-8097-7d7f06e9a510).

**Purpose**:  The executive summary gives students the opportunity to engage in scholarly writing that clearly articulates the outcomes of the program evaluation they completed.

**Task**:  The _Executive Summary of the Program Evaluation_ is used as a key assignment[^1] for SOWK 460w. The CSWE (2022) describes their ninth competency as students being able to evaluate practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Specifically, students will be assessed regarding the identified practice behavior of "select and use culturally responsive methods for evaluation of outcomes; and critically analyze outcomes and apply evaluation findings to improve practice effectiveness" (p. 13). Due to this assignment being a key assignment, although each group will submit the same version of the final paper and receive the same grade, each student must submit the paper via Anthology through MyHeritage assignments.

[^1]: Heritage University's social work program selects assignments across the curriculum for students to demonstrate each practice behavior defined by the CSWE to act as key assignments. These assignments are submitted to Heritage's online portfolio, Anthology Portfolio, and given to all students at each site using the same grading rubric. Student scores help provide data for faculty to self-evaluate the program.

Each group must hand in one final paper that is 10-15 pages long and consists of seven sections: introduction, logic model, ethical framework, methods, data/findings, narrative/discussion, and references.

- The **introduction** provides a description of the agency, a clearly defined research question, and a review of the literature related to the agency type or population served that includes at least ten academic/peer-reviewed articles.
- The **logic model** contains a brief description and a figure representing the program's resources, activities, output, outcomes, and impact.
- The **ethical framework** explains the considerations you made when designing the project. It should be described clearly and consistently. Potential questions answered include: How will you interact with clients, the institution, and subjects? How will you protect the rights and privacy of subjects? With whom will you share data, and why? Did your tasks/timeline ultimately go the way you thought it would? What took longer and why? What was more complicated than you expected, and why?
- The **methods** section explains how you collected your data. Consider the following questions: Why did you do it this way? Is it because of what was available? How did others collect data in the literature? If you did it differently than they did, why not?
- The **data/findings** include a narrative briefly explaining what you found in objective language. You do not need to interpret the results. Use tables and graphs to display data in a simplified way. The tables/graphs should be neat, clear, and self-explanatory.
- You will interpret your findings in the **narrative/discussion** section. What are your conclusions about the institution? What do you recommend? What needs to change? Does it relate to the literature in the introduction? If not, why not? Explain your findings in the context of the literature.
- The **references** section is an APA-formatted list of references cited in your paper.
- Many students will also have documents attached as an **appendix**. These might include forms used or other artifacts from your research that are discussed in the body of the executive summary.

**Success**:  Students will submit a paper demonstrating their ability to use scholarly writing to describe their research project clearly. See Appendix C for the rubric. I will provide feedback before final grades are due by Wednesday 05/15/24 at 5:00 PM.

**Appendices C. CSWE (2022) Competency 9 Practice Behaviors Rubric for Program Evaluation Executive Summary**

The _CSWE (2022) Competency 9 Practice Behaviors Rubric_ evaluates students' ability to use culturally responsive methods and critically analyze outcomes to improve practice. For 1A, it assesses the clarity of the research question, use of academic literature, ethical framework, methods, and cultural considerations, ranging from unclear and unsupported to detailed and well-integrated. For 1B, it evaluates findings articulation, visuals, logic model development, and recommendations, progressing from vague and incomplete to clear, comprehensive, and actionable.

**9a: Select and use culturally responsive methods for the evaluation of outcomes; and**

**A-5a: [Extra Credit] Review of a Published Program Evaluation Paper**

**Meta**: _Points_ 50 pts (5% of total grade in extra credit); _Deadline_ Monday 05/12/25 by 08:00 AM; _Completion_ via MyHeritage Assignments as a file upload; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=42dd4f25-3b3a-457a-84b3-c6471ea1d0f4) and [Syllabus Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=10a180b1-32f9-4bbc-9f37-b1d5e87ac967).

**Purpose**: Program evaluations are frequently published or submitted as formal reports. Reviewing these published versions and providing a review helps engage students in how to write a program evaluation. Offering an assignment for extra credit gives students a designated manner to increase their grades for this class.

**Task**: Students will find a program evaluation that has been published. The article could be a journal article or a published report on an authoritative website. Students will review and summarize the study that was completed by writing a short paper that is between 500 and 750 words in length.

**Success**: Students will submit a paper demonstrating strong academic writing and critical thinking skills. I will provide feedback before final grades are due by Wednesday 05/21/25 at 5:00 PM.

**A-5b: [Extra Credit] Descriptive Review of Groups Program Evaluation**

**Meta**:  _Points_ 100 pts (10% of total grade in extra credit); _Deadline_ Monday 05/12/25 by 08:00 AM; _Completion_ via MyHeritage Assignments as a file upload; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_460W/2425_SP-SOWK_460W-1/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=e2491e82-8794-48d4-8ba7-9851ef278bc2) and [Syllabus Handout](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=0649c0bf-b6b1-41cd-9daa-bba4f3ca919d).

**Purpose**: Evaluating our research process is not usually included in a program evaluation but helps improve our research skills and understanding gained during a project. Offering an assignment for extra credit gives students a designated manner to increase their grades for this class. 

**Task**: The descriptive review of a student's group program evaluation is a paper where students can self-reflect about their project and, through informal interviews with their groupmates and the agency stakeholders, attempt to describe the process and understand the impacts of the program evaluation they have completed. It is to be between 1,250 to 1,500 words in length. It will reflect on the program evaluation process, the feelings and impressions of the group members and stakeholders going through the process, and what potential changes or reactions the agency stakeholders have to the process.

**Success**:  Students will submit a paper demonstrating academic skills. They will be able to demonstrate scientific writing skills. I will provide feedback before final grades are due by Wednesday 05/21/25 at 5:00 PM.
