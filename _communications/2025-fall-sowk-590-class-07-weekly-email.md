I hope you all have a wonderful week!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week seven is an asynchronous week for SOWK 590. Students continue to work at the practicum and will submit their weekly journal.

**Learning Objectives**: Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.

## Unit Assignments

**Weekly Reflective Journals**

Complete the [W-07 A-02 Weekly Reflective Journals](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_590/2526_FA-SOWK_590-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=584b20e2-e6b6-45ae-97f0-c12627b13e50) due before Monday 10/13, 8:00 AM.

Find [09 - September Monthly Practicum Hours Log](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_595/2526_FA-SOWK_595-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=52a366e9-1d04-44d0-a536-71adf35964cd) which is due before Wednesday 10/15, 8:00 AM.

## Unit Resources

For assessment purposes I put both this and your 595 classes together. It is time to submit your midcourse feecback. You can find it on the left sidebar of MyHeritage or by going to - [SOWK 590 Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?CFNK=8FE81FF0-BA23-4813-A04B-13DE6C06DE83&nxappid=HU2&nxmid=GetSurveyForm&wsedrq=H0MLKWE333) and  [SOWK 595 Survey](https://p17.courseval.net/etw/ets/et.asp?nxappid=HU2&nxmid=start). Please complete all of the feedback for all of your courses. For the 590 think about our time in class. For 595 you can think about the site visit and practicum.

I think with the problems that MyHeritage has been having, we've all been frustrated with it. I figured for my resource to share this week is three of the distress tolerance skills that DBT teaches.

- Radical Acceptance
- Self-Soothe with Senses
- Distraction (ACCEPTS)

[The Therapist Aid Worksheet](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/dbt-distress-tolerance-skills) provides a good overview of what these are and how to implement them.

## To-Do List

- Complete your journal entry for week seven
- Complete midcourse feedback
