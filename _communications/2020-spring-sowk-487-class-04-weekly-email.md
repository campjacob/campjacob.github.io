I really enjoy the mutual aid model as a way of doing groups. I think it is very impactful for participating, and the skills can bleed into a number of aspects of general group facilitation. If you are interested, I posted a video on my YouTube channel, [Mutual Aid Model and Children with Special Needs](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/02/mutual-aid-model-children-special-needs/).

You can put in your calendar, next Monday (02/10/20) at 6:30 PM we have the dean of a new MSW program in Oregon (that it working on making it commuting friendly) coming and sharing about their program. It would be great opportunity to hear some of what they have going on in their program. We will be in the SWL bldg. - Lecture Hall 121.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. This week the reading is:

- Garvin et al (2017) __Chapter 7__

During class, the following are topics that we will be covering:

- Mutual aid model

The presentation slides can be viewed through [Notist on my website](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com), where you can download them and follow along during class.
