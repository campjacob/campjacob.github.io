## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Congratulations! You made it to the end of SOWK 486! I hope that you are all feeling a sense of release as you have finished the first semester of your BASW program. Three more, and you will be graduating and moving on to other awesome things. You guys have done a great job this last semester; it has been a pleasure teaching you. We will meet in person for class tomorrow, but it is not mandatory (e.g., you don't have to come if you don't want to).

## Unit Assignments

Take your course evaluation.

I'm going to bring some Mac & Cheese. If there is a game you like to play, you can bring it, and we will spend some time celebrating.
