## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Planning is an integral part of the process of working with clients. As the adage goes, "failing to plan is planning to fail." We can do a lot to help our clients plan, and even the process of teaching them to prepare can have positive long-term impacts. Today, we will spend time looking at goals, and cognitive distortions and practice going through an eight-step process for planning.

The schedule is as follows:

- Information about goals
- The eight steps to planning
- Practice doing the planning process

## Unit Resources

Almost everybody has heard of Maslow (1943) and the hierarchy of needs. It is a highly influential article that has been expanded upon for generations. We will be talking some about the needs, as they are interrelated with the goals and planning we must do as social workers. I'd encourage you to read the article.
