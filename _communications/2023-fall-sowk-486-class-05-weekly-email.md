Looking forward to seeing you all this week! I added 2 extra credit points for everybody for the stump the professor last week. I mentioned before that I made your quizzes in a nerdy and automation way, and tried to find a video that I posted about it before. I wasn't able to find one, so I posted a new one. You can see it [My favorite #automation...](https://social.vsp.ink/@Jacob/111084253634382050) if you are interested.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

The focus of week five for SOWK 486 is on communication skills. There are many that Hepworth et al. (2022) term as verbal following skills. Rogers (1957), who developed the concept of person-centered counseling, described what he called the facilitative condition.  This includes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence. He proposed that when clinicians can maintain these aspects, they can support and help promote positive changes in their clients. The plan for today is to talk about the core skills that help clinicians help their clients. The plan is as follows:

- The facilitative conditions
- Empathy
- Authenticity

## Unit Resources

Being able to have cultural humility is an important aspect of our communication. I really value the concept of cultural humility. Chavez (2013) offers a 30-minute documentation, [_Cultural Humility: People, Principles, and Practices_](https://youtu.be/SaSHLbS1V4w), is useful in understanding this concept.

During class, we listen to a short excerpt from Brené Brown's TED talk, [The Power of Vulnerability](https://youtu.be/iCvmsMzlF7o). The whole thing is great and would recommend it if you are interested. It also gives a good example of qualitative research. It is about 20 minutes.

In the excerpt we use, Brown talks about Wiseman (2007) and her definition of empathy. She is talking about nursing practice, but it is a useful read. You can read _[Toward a Holistic Conceptualization of Empathy for Nursing Practice](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=5eaeeeae-8e60-40e0-a93e-bf5b2c631895)_, attached to this weeks page.
