## Unit Resources

You **need to read** Garvin et al. (2017) Chapter 33

Remember, there is no in-person/synchronous class this week. I'm still going to be in Florida.

## Unit Assignments

**Week Forums**

**Meta**: _Points_ 5; _Deadline_ There are two forums, within the two students need to make at least one reply in each forum by Sunday 04/17/22 at 11:55 PM; _Completion_ Via My Heritage Course Forums.

**Purpose**: Students will have an opportunity to discuss technology-mediated groups and their strategies. They will be able to consider how it can relate to themselves as practitioners and also consider some potential tools to support them in this.

**Task**: Students will complete two discussion forums. Their descriptions are as follows:

[Current Apps or Online Tools](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2122_SP-SOWK_487W-2/W-13_411_—_417.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=298ac681-7a7c-45d6-ba72-7371945827e7) includes the following prompt:

Finch (2017) describes practice strategies for technology-mediated groups based on psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral treatment, and self-help group. Over the last couple of years, there have been many websites, mobile phone applications, and other online resources to assist persons with mental health or different types of issues (around substance abuse behavior change, etc.) in a self-help format. For this forum, students are to find one of these applications or other online format self-help communities and provide a description of it, why it might be helpful for clients, and a citation that would allow the reader to find the resource. Consider joining the community to see what it looks like and how it works to explain the resource better. Your post should be written using an academic style and include both an in-text citation and a reference list entry. To the best of their ability, students should attempt not to duplicate other students' resources to increase the diversity of resources.

[Personal Reflection on Technology](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2122_SP-SOWK_487W-2/W-13_411_—_417.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=1be0a8a0-b4b9-40e1-814a-74a5206aff60) includes the following prompt:

Finch (2017) and class discussions in SOWK 486 and 487 have introduced how you can use technology in social work practice. Students are encouraged to reflect on how they might see using technology in their practice post-graduation.
