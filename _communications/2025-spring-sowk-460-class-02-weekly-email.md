Even with sharing a video, this week feels like week one for us. Excited to see you all for class today.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Program evaluation is an ethical obligation to us as social workers, but also beneficial to staff, agencies, and clients. During week two of this course, we will focus on the why of program evaluation and an overview of the evaluative process. We will also pick our learning teams for the program evaluation you will conduct this semester. The following is the agenda for the class session:
