Thank you all for bearing with me getting this to you a bit later. Also a reminder if you need to join the meeting via zoom verses in person... let me know that you won't be in class and the link for zoom is on the courses main page.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week three of SOWK 486 is about understanding what direct social work practice and some of what makes social workers unique in our helping style. We will start with an exercise, considering how you have been helped in the past.  Many clients we work with as social workers a mandated to participate in services and involuntary in some manner. We will discuss how to engage with them through some best practices. The agenda for the session is as follows:

- How we help
- Evidence-based practice
- Involuntary clients
- Ecological Systems Model
- Social work jobs and roles


## Unit Resources

In your ethics class, you will likely read the entire code of ethics, but it is useful to read through it and familiarize yourself with the values and expectations of being a social worker. You can find it online [National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics](https://www.socialworkers.org/about/ethics/code-of-ethics).

I post all of the presentations online at [presentations.jacobrcampbell.com](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com). You can find the presentation for [SOWK 486 - Week 03 - Direct Social Work Practice](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/matp6V)

We are going to talk about the roles that social workers take on today. I made a video a while back, [The 15 Hats (ahem, Roles) of Social Workers](https://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2019/02/the-15-hats-ahem-roles-of-social-workers/), that also talks about this if you want to use that as a primer.
