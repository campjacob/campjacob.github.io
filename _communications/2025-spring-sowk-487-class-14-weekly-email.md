## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week 14 is focused on group work with youth in a school-based setting. One significant function social workers can have in school is assisting with instruction and acquiring social and emotional learning (SEL) skills. Jones et al. (2021) is an in-depth report on SEL in school and can provide insight into what it is. In addition, social workers often lead groups to work on social skills with youth, and Kumm et al. (2021) give a few examples of how we can implement social skill instruction. During class, we will be looking at several ideas. These include the following.

- Overview of Working in Bridges Program
- Overview of SEL
- Implementation of ART Moral Reasoning
- Ideas for Working with Adolescents and Social Skills

**Assignment 05: Research Paper to Inform Group Practice**

**Meta**: _Points_ 100 pts (20% of final grade); _Deadline_ Monday 04/28/25 at 08:00 AM; _Completion_ File upload via Assignments on MyHeritage; _Locations_ [Assignment Submission](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_487W/2425_SP-SOWK_487W-2/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=60591870-65ab-4bef-b5b4-8d64fb624995) and [Assignment Description and Rubric](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=5ec94f9c-33df-46b4-8727-646450534f5b).

**Purpose**: This assignment is designed for students to demonstrate their ability to apply knowledge gained by reading peer-reviewed journal articles and other quality sources of information.

**Task**: Working individually, students will complete a research paper regarding a facilitated treatment group. It is helpful for the student to select a group they might be interested in providing in the future. The group can be on almost any topic. For instance, you may choose to research chemical dependency, sex offender treatment, sexual abuse recovery, grief and loss, parenting children with special needs, homeless teens, etc. The final paper will be 1,500 to 1,750 words in length. Students should use strong academic and professional writing skills based on the APA style guide. A title page, abstract, written article, and reference page are all included. The paper will consist of at least four sources that guide facilitating your group topic. At least two journal articles must be from peer-reviewed sources.

The final paper should include the following information:

- Discussion, synthesis, and analysis of the findings of the research
- Examination of how the research findings relate to each other, it is helpful to look for themes in the articles and base your paper around those themes
- Use of examples about how the information provided should be applied to practice with groups
- Understanding of how to apply the information to the knowledge of human behavior and the social environment, person-in-environment, and other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks in interventions with clients and constituencies

**Success**: Students will be assessed on their ability to demonstrate effective scholarly writing and practice behaviors. For information, see _Appendix C Research and Intervention Practice Rubric_. Grades will be included in the final grade, which the instructor must submit by Wednesday, 05/21/25, at 5:00 PM. Students can also earn ten extra credit points by demonstrating that they worked with the tutoring services at the Academic Skills Center to review their papers before final submission. Documentation can be emailed to the instructor.

**Appendix C Research Paper to Inform Group Practice Rubric**

The _Research Paper to Inform Group Practice Rubric_ evaluates papers based on their integration of peer-reviewed evidence, application of research to practice, and use of theoretical frameworks. High-quality papers use exclusively peer-reviewed sources and effectively synthesize research into discussions about practice and service delivery. They thoroughly apply knowledge from human behavior and the social environment (HBSE), person-in-environment perspectives, and other multidisciplinary frameworks to interventions.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Use of peer-reviewed evidence-based research. | The sources used do not come from peer-reviewed journals or other more highly academic sources. | One or two of the sources used come from peer-reviewed journals or other more highly academic sources. | A few of the sources used come from peer-reviewed journals or other more highly academic sources. | All of the sources come from come from peer-reviewed journals or other more highly academic sources. |
| Translating research evidence to informed discussion regarding practice and service delivery. | The student's paper has research included in it, but it is not used throughout the paper.

| Apply knowledge of human behaviors and social environment [HBSE] or other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks to interventions with clients and constituencies | There is no inclusion of theories from HBSE or other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks. | Themes from theories are included in the paper (e.g., discussion of looking at strengths) but no relation to the broader theory or how that their gets applied to interventions. | A theory related to HBSE or other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks is directly discussed, and there is limited discussion of how the theory should be applied. The paper lacks a concrete description of what the theory is or how it should be implemented. | The paper clearly discusses at least one theory from HBSE [^1] or other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks in depth and applies it to the content. A discussion of the theory, how it is end implemented, and how it could be applied is present.<br>  |
| Apply knowledge of person-in-environment to interventions with clients and constituencies | Person-in-environment aspects are not included in the discussion regarding the intervention. | Themes from person-in-environment are included in the discussion regarding the interventions, but the discussion lacks the direct look at theories related to an ecological perspective. | The paper includes direct discussion of the ecology and needs of clients in their paper, but lacks some of the concrete application or description of the theoretical frameworks. | The paper discusses ecology and needs and how the topic can affect various parts of a client or constituent's life.

## Unit Resources

During class we went through and did a session of moral reasoning taken from ART. You can find some of the material used including; The [Form](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=52dbd439-4ab2-4ffc-9836-773fb4fdf7f6) where data is collected, [Leader Notes for Reggies Problem](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=82eac8e2-8bf2-459a-b4e0-1cf9a0166fc3), [Reggies Problem](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=8d8f6019-2a25-4a8e-af0c-c46177c5dfd8), and [Thinking Errors](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Portlets/ICS/Handoutportlet/viewhandler.ashx?handout_id=1a85cfbd-b967-483a-bc96-20b410f06f87). The report on SEL by Jones et al. (2021) is lengthy. Students are encouraged to skim this article and maybe pick a section or two that you might read about in it. The engagement question for this article is to just share something that you learned from the article.

We will be talking about social emotional learning as it pertains to using it's development in an educational setting. We watch a short video, [SEL 101: What are the core competencies and key settings](https://youtu.be/ouXhi_CfBVg?si=I7XcFoTGZRv9RScw). We also spend time talking through some of the [competencies describe by CASEL](https://casel.org/fundamentals-of-sel/what-is-the-casel-framework/) as the [OSPI resources for SEL](https://ospi.k12.wa.us/student-success/resources-subject-area/social-emotional-learning-sel). Both of are rich resources a great deal of information for somebody doing social work group in a school setting.
