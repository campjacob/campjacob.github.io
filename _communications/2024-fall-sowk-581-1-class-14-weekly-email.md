**Weekly Online Discussion Forums**

This week, six discussion forums are available for you to engage in. I want you to make a total of **six replies** across any of the forums. At least four replies must be related to any of the prompts provided. The other replies can be answering prompts or replying to your peers. The following is a brief overview of the forums for this week:

- The forum [Chapter 12 Reflection Questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/ðŸ’»_W-14_1118_-_1124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=139fc696-b26c-47d8-a8b1-2e1a84267149) focuses on exploring trauma theory by reflecting on prompts provided in the textbook. These questions examine topics like the impact of traumatic memory, intergenerational trauma, and therapeutic models in case examples like Beth and Lucy.
- The forum [Exploring the Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/ðŸ’»_W-14_1118_-_1124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=6e76f615-8ba3-42eb-b6ed-70d620247e11) invites you to examine this section of the DSM-5-TR. Students can relate their learning to one of the prompts, including describing the criteria, considering similarities and differences between diagnoses, or reflecting on the context of these diagnoses.
- Creativity and making things are sometimes of interest to students. In the forum [Create a Poster or Infographic about Causes and Impact of Attachment Trauma](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/ðŸ’»_W-14_1118_-_1124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=9ca31266-6667-431e-b62f-5615edd66927) provides a space to develop a graphical representation of causes and impacts of attachment trauma.
The textbook provides an example of a practitioner using mentalization-based treatment, and the forum [Skills Used in Mentalization-Based Treatment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/ðŸ’»_W-14_1118_-_1124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=5c1e2a11-68d7-4c16-8ca9-5c82a1e21993) asks students to explore further applications of this therapeutic approach. 
- The forum [Exploring Trauma and Resilience in Media and Literature](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/ðŸ’»_W-14_1118_-_1124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=310b4d07-3929-4175-bc91-128ad8e7876b) asks to explore some of the resources provided this week and share about your findings. 
- The forum [Deeper Dive into Trauma-Focused Treatments](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2425_FA-SOWK_581-1/ðŸ’»_W-14_1118_-_1124.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=f5ad3fa3-c946-4f0f-a31d-f362bd9a1183) encourages you to explore trauma-focused treatment interventions discussed in the textbook. Research one or more approaches, such as EMDR, TF-CBT, or Internal Family Systems Theory, and share details about the techniques, training requirements, or practical applications of the methods in trauma treatment.

While you don't have to post in all the forums, I expect you to read all the posts across all the forums. I want people to make at least some of their posts earlier in the week, and the forums are due by Monday Morning (11/25 at 8 AM).

**Reading Quizzes**

You have a reading quiz, [W-14 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 12]() which is due on It is still due at the same time, **by 8 AM on Saturday, 11/09**.


## Unit Resources

I will post a lecture video here by Friday. I plan to talk about vicarious trauma. SAMHSA has a good paper that can act as a primer to the subject [Understanding Compassion Fatigue](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/understanding-compassion-fatigue/sma14-4869).

One of the forums asks to explore media and literature related to trauma. You could start by picking one of the 56 podcast episodes that fit in the category of [Trauma and Trauma-informed Care](https://www.insocialwork.org/category/trauma-and-trauma-informed-care/). There are many other great resources as well that discuss trauma and its impact. Consider [SAMHSA's Concept of Trauma and guidance for a Trauma-Informed Approach](https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/sma14-4884.pdf) or the [National Child Traumatic Stress Network](https://www.nctsn.org). 

While it goes beyond the scope of this week's assignment, a book that I highly recommend for developing a deeper understanding of trauma is [The Body Keeps The Score - Bessel van der Kolk, MD.](https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score).

## To-Do Lists

- Read chapter 12 in the textbook and do the learning quiz
