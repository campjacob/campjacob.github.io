I hope that you are all doing well and ready for class tomorrow evening. It should be productive. I have updated all of the journal entries for the rest of the semester so they are all there. They are in the discussion forum for each week (plus there is an assignment w/ due date). They are set to private, so only I will be able to read them. 

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week five, we start exploring more of the context around the program evaluation. This includes cultural competency and how we can develop culturally sensitive program evaluations. We will also start a discussion around gathering information for the logic model. The agenda is as follows:

- Peer review group work plans
- Explore cultural competency
- Adding cultural sensitivity to program evaluation 
- Introduction to logic models
