I hope you are all doing well! On of the forums ask you to watch a movie or a TV show (I know, tell everybody that I'm mean and make you do really hard things). Something I was thinking about, is if people wanted to do some sort of movie watch party (see the doing an MSE below on a character in a movie forum), I could try to plan something for (probably would be Thursday or Friday early evening) via Zoom. If there are a number of people interested let me know and I will set it up (just tell me if you are). Have a great week!

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

In week three, we are delving into the work of assessment. This week is asynchronous. Students will read the textbook, focusing on content related to biopsychosocial assessments, participate in forums on this topic, develop a consent form, and explore the types of content and questions used in assessments, as well as develop a diagnosis and/or mental status examination. During my lecture video, we will discuss consent and share examples of assessment forms. The agenda for the lecture video is:

- Assignments for the Week
- Consent form
- Simple Assessment Example
- MH Evaluations 

The Learning Objectives for this week include:

- Identify the common categories for biopsychosocial assessments and what information clinicians generally gather in those sessions.
- Develop an initial draft of the informed consent and biopsychosocial assessment forms they will use for their case study paper.
- Students will practice assessing for a mental status examination using a fictional character


## Unit Assignments

**Content**

- Read Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 3 _The Biopsychosocial Assessment_
- Read Renn and John (2019) _Mental Status Examination_
- Explore the other resources shared
- Watch my lecture video

**A-01: Asynchronous Participation and Engagement**

The expectation is that each of your replies will be substantive and provide meaningful perspectives, contributing to the forum's conversation and scholarship. They can be related to the prompts or building on conversations shared by peers. There are four forums for this week, and you are expected to make at least **six replies** across any of the forums. These forums include the following:

- After reading the textbook, students can engage in [chapter 03 reflection questions](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-03_98-914.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=9c2e113b-3583-47fc-b323-78a26f99aa1c) to explore how clinicians use diagnostic reasoning and therapeutic practices.
- In starting to look more at your case study paper (and the biopsychosocial assessment you will be doing), students have a space to [develop a consent form for the case study paper](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-03_98-914.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=d3ed83a4-1bae-495b-840d-976f77c2d520).
- In considering biopsychosocial assessments, reviewing what a clinician evaluates for and what questions they ask during an assessment is helpful. In the forum, [questions used and content evaluated in developing a biopsychosocial assessment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-03_98-914.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=92f324fe-1816-43c1-968c-fbc36436dc3d), students have the opportunity to share their ideas.
- Also in preparation for the biopsychosocial assessment, the forum [Developing the Form for Your Biopsychosocial Assessment](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-03_98-914.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=eb81134e-5168-49bb-aee9-b3f6684bf11d) provides a space to share examples of assessment forms or share ideas for creating your own.
- Mental status examinations are complicated and require practice. To consider this, the forum [actor representation of mental health disorder and mental status examination](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/ðŸ’»_W-03_98-914.jnz?portlet=Group_Discussion_Forums&screen=PostView&screenType=change&id=303941f0-db79-45ed-bff6-d44c97c6516a) forum provides a space for students to practice both evaluating this based off of a movie.

**Reading Quizzes**

Complete [W-03 Reading Quiz for Cooper and Granucci Lesser (2022) Chapter 03](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_581/2526_FA-SOWK_581-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=be16c69d-41a5-41f5-9145-64429466f5e5) due by Saturday 9/13, 8:00 AM.

## Unit Resources

In the forums, I provide a number of resources that might be helpful in discussing some of the topics. PsychDB (2024a and 2024b) provide good resources for [Mental Status Exam (MSE)](https://www.psychdb.com/teaching/mental-status-exam-mse) and the [Psychiatric Interview](https://www.psychdb.com/teaching/1-psych-interview). I am uploading a chapter by Renn and John (2019) that is uploaded as a handout. It is helpful in going deeper into the understanding mental status examinations. In looking at consent, the forum includes a number of resources that could be helpful.
