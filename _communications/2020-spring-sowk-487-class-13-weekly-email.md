I hope that you are all well. Just a reminder we don't have a Zoom class session this week, but if you need anything don't hesitate to reach out to me.

To be prepared for class, you should complete the weekly reading prior to class this week. This week the reading is:

- Garvin et al (2017) __Chapter 33__

This week is an online discussion format for class. There are two questions. You can either find them by going to course work and they are listed there as assignments or if you go to the collaboration section of My Heritage and go to the forums. The questions are as follows:

## Week 13 Discussion Forum 01

Finch as writing in Garvin, Gutierrez, and Galinsky (2017) describes practice strategies for technology-mediated groups that are based on psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral treatment, and self-help group. Over the last couple of years, there have been a number of websites, mobile phone applications, and other online types of resources to be assistive to persons with mental health or other types of issues (around substance abuse behavior change, etc.) in a self-help format. For this forum, students are to find one of these applications or other online format self-help communities and provide a description of it, why it might be useful for clients, and a citation that would allow the reader to find the resource. Consider joining the community to see what it looks like and how it works to better be able to explain the resource. Your post should be written using an academic style, and include both an in-text citation and a reference list entry. Students should to the best of their ability attempt to not duplicate other students resources to increase the diversity of resources. Students will use their replies to vote for the website or application that they find either the most interesting or the most useful. You will pick two posts to reply to and be able to vote for your classmate's post by making a reply.

## Week 13 Discussion Forum 02

Both in Gavin et. al (2017) as written by Finch and during the various class discussion around technology in both SOWK 486 and 487 there have been a number of ways that technology has been introduced and discussed as a part of practice. Students are encouraged to reflect on how they might see using technology in their practice post-graduation. They are to make two replies to their classmates' posts to facilitate discussion about how they see using technology in their career.
