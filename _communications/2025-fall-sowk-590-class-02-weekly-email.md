Let me know if there is anything about practicum as well that I can help with. Consider bringing some planned dates on Saturday for potential initial site visits.

## Unit Introduction and What You Will Learn

Week two is synchronous with having class on Saturday (09/06/25) for SOWK 590. We will have the following agenda:

- Learning contracts and reminders
- SLED: Safety, Well Being, and Self-Care
- Mindfulness activity
- Practice Learning Reflection Group

The learning objectives this week include:

- Students consider safety, well-being, and self-care, and how these aspects relate to their practice.
- Students will actively practice a mindfulness activity.
- Students will recognize the shared experiences of their peers in the practicum and be able to utilize the group as a method for sharing and problem-solving.
- Students will analyze their practicum experience, reflecting on how it connects to their development and demonstration of competence.

## Unit Assignments

**Monthly Practicum Hours Log**

For the hours you had last month, please review them with your supervisor and have them sign them, and then submit them in the SOWK 595 class [August Monthly Practicum Hours Log](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_595/2526_FA-SOWK_595-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=c24e494b-db28-4396-ac6d-2258bd26726f) due before Monday, 9/15, 8:00 AM.

**Student-Led Discussion**

There are still about five of you who have not signed up for which week you will do the SLED activity. You can see the Google Doc [2025 SOWK 590.0 Student-Led Discussion Groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NAbT-qAHL9dpozHnHuiaVxhlBZRqfMTHsCX4J68yqYk/edit?usp=sharing). For the two that signed up for this week, **Safety & Well Being, Self-Care**, please come prepared to facilitate this discussion on Saturday.

**Weekly Reflective Journals**

Complete the [W-02 A-02 Weekly Reflective Journals](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_590/2526_FA-SOWK_590-0/Assignments.jnz?portlet=Coursework&screen=AssignmentDetailView&screenType=change&id=0bd19139-49e3-4ea8-9717-893390d46326) due before Monday 9/8, 8:00 AM.

**Learning Contracts**

You should still be working on developing your learning contract. I want to schedule our initial meetings/site visits for week three. If you are ready to plan those, please send me some dates that work for you, your supervisor, and potentially task managers/administrators.

## Unit Resources

Our mindfulness activity this week is Box Breathing. Sometimes it is referred to as 4x4 breathing or equal breathing. It is particularly helpful for calming ourselves during moments of high stress, and it is beneficial to incorporate into our practice. Lauria et al. (2017) describe several skills, including box breathing, that can be used to enhance the performance of emergency care providers under stress. I've included it as a resource if you are interested.

Another place where I think you can learn about this is [Limitless with Chris Hemsworth - On Disney+](https://ondisneyplus.disney.com/show/limitless-with-chris-hemsworth). In my district behavioral program, we actually watched this whole series with the kids. It has a lot of great content. They come out with a new season that I haven't watched yet. In Season 1, Episode 1, "Stress-Proof," the strategy is also discussed (Lynch Robinson, 2022). 

All of the presentations for this class can be found at <https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com>. This week's slides are [Fall 2025 SOWK 590 Week 02 - Advanced Seminar I](https://presentations.jacobrcampbell.com/mg39jn).

The [Lecture Videos](https://myheritage.heritage.edu/ICS/Academics/SOWK/SOWK_590/2526_FA-SOWK_590-0/Lecture_Videos.jnz) tab in the MyHeritage course is where you will be able to find class recordings. The video this week is at `[Fall 2025 SOWK 590 Week 02]()`.
