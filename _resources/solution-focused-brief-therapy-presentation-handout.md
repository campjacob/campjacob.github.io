## Directions of Focus

  * Spend 25% of our time focusing on the circumstances
  * Spend 75% of our time focusing on the goals

## About SFBT

  * Steve de Shazer, Insoo Kim Berg, and their colleagues developed Solution-Focused Brief Therapy starting in the late 1970’s
  * Utilized in business, social policy, education, criminal justice services, child welfare, and domestic violence offender treatment
  * Solution building, not problem solving
  * Not focused on giving advice but giving the client the chance to direct the process

## Tenets of SFBT

  * If it’s not broken, don’t fix it
  * Look for exceptions
  * Asking questions rather than telling clients what to do
  * Future is negotiated and created
  * Complements
  * Gentle nudging to do more of what is working
  * Change is constant and inevitable
  * The solution is not always directly related to the problem

## SFBT Interventions

  * Not knowing
  * Complementing strengths
  * Scaling questions
  * Exception questions
  * Coping questions
  * Miracle question

## SFBT Connects to
