The following is a Microsoft PowerPoint Slideshow I created and used when a co-woker requested that I speak about case management at [Heritage University][1] for her Social Work Theory class.

The presentation included a video I downloaded and embedded into the presentation off of YouTube. You can check out [Social Service Delivery][7] I thought it was pretty funny and good way to think about how to not do case management.
