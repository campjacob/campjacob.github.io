When I was working on my Master's in Social Work Degree in 2009 my employer, YFA Connections: Crisis Residential Center asked me to put together a training for their staff. At the time I had been taking a class regarding Solution-focused Brief Therapy. I later re-used (with the present changes) this presentation for the case manager at Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services Department in 2011. Steve de Shazer, Insoo Kim Berg, and their colleagues developed Solution-Focused Brief Therapy starting in the late 1970â€™s. The intent of SFBT is to change the focus of therapy from symptoms and problems and to focus on actually finding the solutions. In my presentation (which doesn't upload well to this site, I use a video I downloaded from YouTube called [Solution Focused Hunter][1].

I created a Powerpoint Presentation, some hand out forms, and some interactive activities. I also completely designed the PowerPoint design layout. You can download [the PowerPoint file][2].
