<div style="border:#000 thick solid; position: relative; display: block; margin-left:115px; padding: 10px;"><p style="font-weight:bold;">Step 1:  Self-efficacy</p><p>The first step in <span style="font-style:italic;">empowerment theory</span> is the empowering of the client.  This means helping them to gain self-efficacy.  This can be done by the following:</p><ul><li>Skill building</li><li>Gaining self-awareness</li><li>Learning to navigate systems</li></ul></div><br />

Some examples of this are as follows:</p><ul><li>Identifying barriers</li><li>Defining power</li><li>Connecting the client to a group</li><li>Letting them know they aren't alone</li></ul></div><br />

The following are some possible ideas:</p><ul><li>Creating policy and or legal changes</li><li>Having the client act as a mentor</li><li>Connecting to another activity that allows them to make social change</li></ul></div><br />
