# The Scientific Method

Researching should follow the scientific method. Research is a scientific endeavor that has direct practice implications. Due to this the scientific model ought to be utilized. The process of describing the variables and aspects of a study is known as over capitalization. The first phase is looking at problem formulation. There are some concerns to look at in regards to the area of study.

  * **The So What Factor**: The study must have clear significance for social work in order for study to have merit
  * **Feasibility**: Is the study possible? Is it a practical? The researcher must factor in the time, cost, potential participant cooperation, etc of the study.
  * **Ethical Constraints**: The researcher must look into the [ethical considerations][1] in doing the research (the benefits must out weight the risks).
  * **Relevant**: The research should come from problems within social service agencies or practical problems regarding social welfare in general.
  * **Applied Approach**: The study needs to have a link to social work concerns (it's not just collecting data for the fun of it).
  * **Implementation**: The results are to be used to guide practice and or policy

## Research Process

The process of research is as follows;

**Phase 1: Problem Formulation**

  * A question is posed and is progressively refined to become more meaningful and feasible
  * The unit of analysis (e.g. level or system size), hypotheses, research questions, and being operationally defined (working definition - "counting" the variables) are all concepts that are explained during phase 1.
  * Furthermore a literature review is to be conducted regarding previous related studies. The researcher ought to ask what did they find and look into the weaknesses of these studies.

**Phase 2: Study Design**

  * Decisions are to be made about planning the study.
  * Study procedures are to be created (e.g. sampling, measurement tools, analysis of the results.
  * The [type of study design][2] should be formulated.

**Phase 3: Data Collection**

  * Implementation of the study design   
Remember: differences between qualitative (flexible) and quantitative (rigid)

**Phase 4: Data Processing**

**Phase 5: Data Analysis**

**Phase 6: Interpreting Findings**

  * Discussion of findings
  * Exploring alternate explanations

**Phase 7: Writing the Research Report** (Must be APA Style)
