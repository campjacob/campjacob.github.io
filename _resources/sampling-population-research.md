# Sampling

Sampling and population are two important and often confused subjects in research. They can be defined as;

**Population:** Theoretically specified group of studied elements or the large group results are generalized to

**Sample:** Study participants, usually a smaller group or a subset of the population

**Sampling:** process of selective study participants

There are two types of sampling, probability and it's opposite. Within there these general types, there are many different examples and kinds. A few of them are listed below.

## Probability Sampling

* Every member of the population has a known & equal chance of being selected for the study
* Random selection is a key element

1. **Simple Random Sampling:** Each member of population is assigned a number, then random drawing of numbers is done.
2. **Systematic Random Sampling:** Every kB element is selected (i.e. every 4th name is chosen)
3. **Stratified Random Sampling:**
    * Group of participants are in layers / levels
    * Break into groups, then randomly select from the groups

## Non-Probability Sampling

* Not random
* Unequal chance of selection

Types of non-probability sampling methods include:

- **Snowball Sampling**
    * Participants refer others to the study
    * Works well with hidden populations
- **Convenience or Available Participants**
	* Just choosing participants because the people are available
    * Often if a survey in the middle of the pub
- **Quota**
    * The non-random parallel to stratified sampling
    * Characteristic qualifies for study (i.e. demographic, ageâ€¦etc)
- **Purposive Sampling**
    * Criteria or diagnostic category qualifies for participation (not random)
    * For example, finding information on people who have been molested and their cases have been brought to court
