# Level of Measurement

* **Nominal:** Name only, just words - numbers have no ranking, weight, meaning.
    - Gender
    - Yes or No
    - Ethnicity (African American, Native American, Asian American, Caucasianâ€¦ etc)
* **Ordinal:** Ranking or weighting of responses, but not real mathematical properties
    - Attitude surveys
        Strongly Agree | Agree | Disagree | Strongly Disagree
    - Questions that ask for relative answers and are formatted by least to most
* **Interval:** Mathematical properties, even spacing between categories & no true zero

* **Ratio:** Raw numbers, true zero
    - precise, exact - "How many times did you miss class?"

# Statistically Viable, Areas to Explore

## Reliability

* Reliability focuses on consistency
* The scale being off, so appears to be valid

## Validity

* Validity focuses on the accuracy of the statistics
* Having the scale be the correct number
* Does the measure the measure?

# Methods of Data Collection

## Qualitative: More ideographic method of data collections

* Open ended questions & answers
* Depth of human experience
* Instead of stats we analyze themes & patters of quotes
* More in respondent's own words
* Focus groups or ethnographic interview
* Inductive (not testing a hypotheses)

## Quantitative: A non-mothetic & deductive method of data collection

* Statistical & closed ended
* Helps make generalizations / describes large groups
* Superficial - not in-depth
