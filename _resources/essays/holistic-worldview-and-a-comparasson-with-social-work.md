  Holistic Worldview
  Readings: A More Perfect Union by Wood (2012); Dellinger (2017 & 2014) articles; and Review videos on MLK and An Ecology of Mind.
  We’re shifting to a different topic now, and we’ll be looking at the bigger picture. We’ll begin with A More Perfect Union we’ll be looking at the roots of the Holistic Worldview in the US through biographical sketches of key individuals and one institution, the Esalen Institute. You saw how all three of the articles you just read argued, in one form or another, for a more holistic view of the world, and a more holistic approach to research. Now the term holistic is generally contrasted w/atomistic or reductionistic, meaning an approach that focuses on the whole rather than the parts, and on breaking things down into their parts in order to understand them. This’ll become clearer with the readings, and I also urge you to think back on the papers you just read while you’re reading this material. The Wood book gives you a sense of how the holistic worldview emerged in a number of different fields, from psychology to philosophy to social justice. We’ll be looking specifically at Martin Luther King as a holistic thinker, and exploring how his message and vision were deeply holistic, and also very countercultural in the US. Particularly interesting is how this worldview can be applied from science to thinking about what it means to be a human being. The Morin book is an application of the latest iteration of the holistic worldview, what for me is the most sophisticated version of it, what Morin calls Complex Thought.  The holistic worldview is part of the same family as systems theory & complexity theory, and inevitably there’s confusion about how they’re all related, how they’re different, etc. If there’s any interest, we can have a zoom session where I go over some of this stuff. Make sure you watch the videos, they’ll provide lots of important background. Gregory Bateson was a fascinating thinker and definitely part of this larger family of thought, as are Fritjof Capra and Joanna Macy, and of course MLK. I’ve also added two articles by Drew Dellinger on MLK as a holistic thinker. Drew also happens to be a CIIS graduate, which makes it all the more relevant, I think.

The topic and concepts of a holistic worldview are intriguing to me. I teach a number of classes for Heritage Universities Social Work Program. Two courses that I have taught for a number of years are Theories of Practice I and II. In general, these two classes are focused on skills and interventions for working with clients and the theoretical background for those. The first semester is about working with individuals. The second semester is about working with families and groups. In looking at the theoretical background for these interventions, we dive briefly into some layers of abstraction in what are perspectives, theories, and frameworks or models. Frameworks and models are a type of blueprint for actions. In direct practice with clients, it would the specific tasks that we would be doing. For example, somebody can practice using a solution-focused framework or using the specific treatment model of solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT). Each of the models or frameworks are couched within their own theories and understanding of the world. At an even broader level of understanding is that of a perspective. A perspective is an overall way that you see the world and kind of influence everything through that lens. Kind of like a worldview or somebody's paradigm.

What I find the most interesting about the idea of a worldview or a paradigm is that it really does involve a value judgment. The same way taking a less holistic world view such as atomistic or reductionistic.  Miller (2000) arguing for a more holistic perspective on education states:

> "A holistic worldview is a profound respect for the diversity of life, of cultures, of species, and a profound understanding of their subtle but vital interconnections. A holistic worldview sees the earth as a whole, and perhaps in some sense living, entity — Gaia" (p. 391).

In defining reductionistic Miller goes attempts to summarize reductionistic through how he describes current psychology in the modern age as "fundamentally materialistic, mechanistic, objectivistic, atomistic" (p. 383). 

Gregory Bateson, an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician, and cyberneticist whose work intersected that of many other fields, would appear to fall squarely on the holism side. Where Reductionism seems to be focused on understanding the parts of systems and that understanding parts would provide the information necessary to understand the whole. Bateson spoke about generalizations versus specialization. He appeared to focus on the context of systems, their relationships, and the function and purpose (the difference that makes a difference). That these ideas are comprised of a mass tangle of ideas and relationships (Bateson, 2010).

In social work education, the framework of person-in-environment is a tentpole and found throughout the practice behaviors of social workers (Council on Social Work Education, 2015). That when looking at engaging, assessing, intervening and evaluating with clients, it is an approach that decidedly looks both the individual and the environment. More than looking at them separately it is about the transactions between them, interdependence, and interfaces (Kirst-Ashman & Hull, 2012). While Martin Luther King Jr didn't self describe himself as a holist (Wood, 2012), King looked at the connections in the world, where he seemed to "emphasize the connections between racism, militarism and economic injustice, and to see continuities across social movements" (Dellinger, 2017, para. 3). King looked into the interrelated nature of the world, the world's ecology, and even the cosmos (Dellinger, 2004).

Wood (2012) describes holism as a type of wrestling with problems and probing them for understanding. That is is a broader focus that the individual thinker, but how does it connect and intersect with the community. Woods describes that holistic thinkings don't end up being mired in the angst and turmoil of the problems that they are wrestling with. That they are able to have a sense of optimism about the future. I think this for me, is a valuable thought for us to take with us as we dive further into our understandings of the world.  What are the ways that we can help the world reconcile? That we can be like King during his last Christmas sermon

> "I still have a dream that with this faith we will be able to adjourn the councils of despair and bring new light into the dark chambers of pessimism. With this faith, we will be able to speed up the day when there will be peace on earth and goodwill toward men" (Recording found on Sudekum, 2014)
