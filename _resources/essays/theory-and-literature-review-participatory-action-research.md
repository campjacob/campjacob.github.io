  In your Varieties of  Scholarly Experience course you explored the role of theory in research. Now that you have been immersed in the literature for your inquiry, how are you seeing the role of theory and theoretical frameworks in your evolving study? Which theories and theorists have come to the fore?

Theoretical frameworks and research are interconnected. Grant and Osanloo (2014) describe writing a dissertation to follow the allegory of building a house.

> The theoretical framework is the foundation from which all knowledge is constructed (metaphorically and literally) for a research study. It serves as the structure and support for the study's rationale, the problem statement, the purpose, the significance, and the research questions. The theoretical framework provides a grounding base, or an anchor, for the literature review, and most importantly, the methods and analysis (p. 12).

My dissertation will be a qualitatively designed research project. I will be using both methodologies and theories related to participatory action research. Salmons (2019) posits that the selected theoretical framework relates to the research design and helps the researcher situate themselves within their methodology and epistemological position. 

Last semester, I wrote about _[Understanding Theoretical Frameworks Through the Example of Participatory Research](https://jacobrcampbell.com/resources/essays/understanding-theoretical-frameworks-through-the-example-of-participatory-research/)_, (Campbell, 2020). Freire (1921/2000) describes what he calls _problem-posing education_ as a way of breaking the vertical patterns characteristic of banking education.  In this dialogue, the relationship moves away from being teacher-of-the-students, and students-of-the-teacher moves to a new concept of teacher-student and student-teacher. At the core of participatory action research is the interrelationship between the facilitator and co-researchers. It is through this process "people develop their power to per­ceive critically _the way they exist_ in the world _with which_ and _in which_ they find themselves; they come to see the world not as a static reality, but as a reality in process, in transformation" (p. 83).

Participatory action research features both the accumulation of knowledge and rigor in contextual determinacy (Borda, 2008). Alcoff (1991) highlights the importance of working as co-researchers. Action research is useful for creating transformation and change within educational systems (Altrichter & Posch, 2013; Saunders & Somekh, 2013)  Chevalier and Buckles (2019) describe participatory action research as both a scientific technique and theory.
